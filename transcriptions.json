        "original": " Once upon a time you see, in a strange lamp not far away, I met the chance a little bee upon a most unusual day. And when I asked who she was, she told me, my heart, no one be could ever be like my heart. My wife questioned me, why is no one so far away? My, my, she's always in a pretty pickle, my heart. Helping someone else's little my heart. My, everyone loves my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, come tell us what you see. Oh, hello my friends, as you can see, I'm a grasshopper, my name is Flip, I hope you like me, I know I look funny, but you get used to me, I come here often. At the moment, I'm not sure what story to tell you, nothing interesting has happened to me today at all. I think the life of a grasshopper can be very boring. Eating grass all the time and hopping about isn't very exciting, although I do like eating. I'm bored. I always said, but if I there was my friend, he has a swarm of bees coming along, back from gathering honey. There's such hard working little fellows, I really think they work too hard. They always fly in a swarm. Hello, hello my friends. Hello. Did you collect a lot of honey today? I'd be so happy if you'd give me a drop. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Well, just like them, busy busy all the day, not even time to say hello, how unfriendly they are, they make me drop by hat. Oh, ah, oh, oh, I wonder why I know that they're back so early. They usually stay away much longer, something must be wrong. I wonder what is happening. All the spuzz in your body is most unusual, perhaps we're in luck and something exciting is going to happen. Hey, little creepy crawly, are you going for a walk? I want to eat a cake. No, I don't think you can talk, he's still too young, he's just like a baby. All he does is open his mouth, I think he must be hungry. I know, there must be trouble in the beehive. It's on the other side of the ruined castle behind the big pine tree, a fine safe place. I don't don't go and see. It's a matter, I don't know let me in, don't know who I am. If you don't know the past, where'd you come from? Of course you know me, I'm Cassandra, I was your teacher when you were at school. Cassandra? Today's a great hatching day, if you don't get me in all the little bees will die. You should have a good look at people before you say you don't know this. We're so sorry but you know we've got rules to obey, lots of people try to get in here and make trouble and we're in charge here. You ought to have enough sense to change the rules at an important time like this. Don't you ever think first to silly boys? He just knows it was so important. Can I come in now? That's alright, Cassandra flying, yes, yes. Here I am at last. We've been waiting a long time, may my hatch out any moment now. They're coming, let's help them. Stay where I put you. I want my money. I want my money. I want my money. I want my money. I want my money. How do I get out of here? How could this be a door somewhere? Oh dear. You're dead? That's Maya. I just have to break you open. Oh, oh. Hello, anyone at home? Yes, Maya. We've been waiting for you. You're the last one to come out. And who is Maya? Am I Maya? Why did you call me Maya? Tell me please. Well, actually there's no real reason. Everybody's got to have a name. Oh, are you got a name? Yes, I'm Cassandra. I'll look after you till you're big. Come. I'm glad I'm out. It was hot inside. It sure owned fault. The others came out long ago. What made you wait so long? I had a beautiful dream. A dream, but Maya please never dream. Perhaps someday I'll tell you what I dreamt. It was such fun. What happens now? Shall I jump? Are you coming to fetch me? Wait, I'll fetch you. Don't worry. You're quite safe. Come along. Your life is just beginning and there's so much to learn. Oh, what are they doing? They're learning to fly in a swamp. So what's that? Weebees always fly in a swamp. I don't understand. It's a little difficult to understand. I'll teach you easier things first. I hope so. And why do they do that? Weebees have done that ever since we began. A long time ago. And why did we do this? Why don't you tell me, Miss Cassandra, I want to know why. How am I ever going to learn anything about life if you want to tell me about things? Be patient, Maya. I can't explain everything to her at once. Come, let's do it in the others. All right. And in the comb they put the eggs. Why do they do that? The eggs line the comb like birds eggs in the nest. And after a few weeks a little bees hatched. Just as you did. Was it iron and egg like that? Yes, you were. And then another bee comes and shuts it tight with wax. They are the worker bees. They only work inside the hive. They build the hive and look after the eggs. They're very busy. For the queen lays a lot of eggs every day. I don't suppose you can remember when you were inside an egg, do you? Goodness. What is that child up to now? Oh, it's heavy. I've managed it. Oh, there you are. See, Miss Cassandra, I can do it as well. Good. But only one egg in each hole. But why? If there were two eggs together they could talk to each other. They wouldn't be so lonely, would they? Maya, we bees weren't born to spend our days talking. We were born to work. I worry about you. You really have such funny ideas in your little head. I like my idea two eggs instead of one. My idea, Maya, experience has proved that one egg is better. But why is it better? We could make much bigger combs for bigger eggs. Come along, let's get along. Oh, that smells good. What is it? I'm hungry. Oh, it is good. That's honey that you can smell. Oh, I can't move this as the others can. It's too heavy for you. Is that all honey? Yes, we store the honey for the winter in here. Maya, come back here at once. Oh, it's lovely, Miss Cassandra. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Good to sweat our naughty child. Oh. What a miss you're in, Maya, really. Honey, taste nice. But it's a little too sweet. Come along, school is beginning. Now you're old enough, I'm going to take you on a trip to the outside world to see the sky. Miss Cassandra, would you please tell me what the sky is, I want to know. Just wait until we get there, then I'll explain everything to you. But don't think it's all fun out there. Little bees aren't allowed out there on their own. Do you understand? Oh. I'm curious out there, you must understand how wicked it is and be very careful. Yes, I knew that Miss Cassandra, because I've been in this class for two years already. Then you should know that this is a wasp and there are worst enemies. There are ten times bigger than we are, so be very careful of them. No, there's no need for this. Now get back to your seats. There are no wasps inside the hive, they can't get in. So you really needn't be scared at all my little ones. Miss Cassandra, you're a frog. Never fly too low over water because that's what my cat is. He's got a very long tongue. Don't worry, a frog can never get in here. Miss Cassandra, does that mean you must never never go near where there are any frogs? Correct, Willie. Don't forget. Are you Willie? Yeah, I'm Willie. You seem to be very clever. No, it's just that I've heard this lesson for years. Where are I and Maya? Have you heard about me? Yes, but only terrible things. You ask people so many questions they want to scream. The world can be a very cruel place. For example, when it rains it isn't a tall knife. When that happens, come back home or hide under a leaf. If it's raining outside, what's the best thing for a little bee to do? Will he? Do you know? Well, he should stay at home. What would happen if he didn't stay at home, Miss Cassandra? My dear child, I've just told you. What's that terrible noise? Please stay at your desk. I'll be back very soon. Run some matter. Oh, no, what's happening? Something must be wrong. Maya, Maya, where are you going? Come back. I'm going outside. No, Maya, Maya, come back. It isn't safe to go outside. Don't do this. What are you doing? Help. Don't do this. Oh, my god! Help. Ah, ah, ah! Help. Don't do this. Oh my goodness. Where is his house come from? You be quiet! Come on, come in! What's going on here? Stop crying, it's not so. You are the skin quiet. Where are you? Where are you? He's gone. You've killed everybody since I'm in charge. You've killed that city. I look at what? I met him. That's not a real one. It's the one before. It's only a picture. But since I'm in charge, I'll show you something else. This is a spider. Isn't he ugly? Is he dangerous too? I saw a real one. Her name was Martha and you know what? She'd be the fiddle. No, it isn't. This is a dandy lion. I'm leaving the teacher to make him a steak. There's a strong wind blowing outside. And it isn't too nice. This guy isn't blue anymore. Ms. Cassandra said it was beautiful. She's cute. Why not? I wonder what flow is that? What's going on in here? Ms. Cassandra. Willy, what are you doing here? Didn't I tell you all to share your desk to the... I was. I... Thank you, Willy. Maya, can you tell me what this is? Oh, where is she? Does anybody know where she is? Did anybody see her going out? Yes, I saw her going out. I know exactly where she's gone. She wanted to see her store. Oh no, what a naughty child she is. I have to watch her all the time, the silly girl. The world is looking beautiful again. Oh, is that funny little girl man again? Come on, I'll give you your hand and dance with me. Sing with me, come with me. Sing and play and have some fun and laugh with me. Come on, I'll give you your hand right now. Like a carousel I turn around and round, round and round, round and round, one and one and two and three so fun with me. Turn around I'll show you why. You will be on this stand. This is wonderful. When we dance the piece and flowers spin around. Come on, I'll give you your hand and dance with me. Sing with me, come with me. Sing and play and have some fun and laugh with me. Come and dance and jump with me. Rally and wave and wave and wave and wave. Lift and go, right and dance with me. One, two, three, and you're done. Like a carousel we go round and round, round and round. Round and round! Come and have some fun with me! They're very good! Maya, Maya! Where are you, Maya? Where are you? Maya! Answer me at once! It's your teacher, Miss Cassandra! Maya! Where are you, Maya? I saw it happen, I'm telling you. You're always in that. What's wrong? Have you seen a little bee? If you're looking for that naughty little girl, she's out there. Let her stay there for a few minutes and learn a good lesson. Maya! Is that your Miss Cassandra? I should sting you now! Now that you're trapped! You've been very naughty, Maya. I'm going to have to punish you and send you to bed straight away. I didn't do anything bad, I just want to do it. Doesn't matter, you caused me a lot of trouble. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! And don't go exploring again. Yes, I'm sorry. Now, just lie there quietly and go to sleep. Oh, hmm. Why is it naughty of me to want to see the outside world? Next time, I'll be clever and run away when nobody's looking. Then they'll never find me. This was our first story about bees. I hope you'll be watching next time, because if you are, I'll tell you a little secret. Next time we meet, you'll see how big Maya is growing. She's ready to learn to fly, but not alone. Miss Cassandra is with her to see that she keeps out of trouble. Bye-bye, you seeing ya! Miss Cassandra is with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's with her to see that she's With Komm &",

E agora j\u00e1 posso entrar? Se a casadra pode voar l\u00e1 para dentro. Finalmente. H\u00e1 muito tempo que estamos a esperar devem estar quase a jocar. A\u00ed vem elas, vamos. N\u00f3s sa\u00edmos daqui. N\u00f3s sa\u00edmos daqui. Como \u00e9 que voc\u00ea \u00e9 daqui? Voc\u00ea \u00e9 daqui a uma porta? \u00c9... \u00c9 a maia. O ter de romper. Ol\u00e1, est\u00e1 algu\u00e9m em casa? Sim, meia. Temos estado aqui \u00e0 tua espera. For\u00e7a \u00faltima na sia. Quem \u00e9 a maia? Sou a maia. Por que voc\u00ea me chamou a maia? Tiga-me para favor. Ah... Bem, na verdade, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 nenhuma raz\u00e3o especial. Toda a gente tem o nome. Ah... A senhora tamb\u00e9m tem o nome? Enxame o casadro. Toma conta de voc\u00eas o que h\u00e1 a ser em grandes. Vem c\u00e1. \u00c9 ainda bem que o confio est\u00e1 calor. Aculpetua, as outras j\u00e1 sa\u00edram h\u00e1 muito tempo. Por que que morar este tanto? Tive um sonho lindo. Um sonho, mas maias, abalhas nunca sonham. Talvez um dia ele contou meu sonho foi t\u00e3o divertido. Bom, eu s\u00f3 estou atona com o casadro vem me c\u00e1, pescar. Espere, vou pescar-te. Calma, pare. A tua vida est\u00e1 apenas a come\u00e7ar e h\u00e1 tanta coisa para aprender. Oh! O que que eu estou a fazer? Estou a aprender a viver em enxame. Enxame? O que isso? A abalhas v\u00e3o sempre em enxame. Por que? \u00c9 um bocadinho dif\u00edcil de perceber. Primeiro vou ensinar de coisas mais f\u00e1ceis. Por que que elas fazem isso? N\u00f3s as abalhas fazemos isto desde que insistimos. E por que que as abalhas fazem isso? Por que que nome desprefe\u00e7ora Cassandra? Quer saber por que? Como \u00e9 que vou aprender alguma coisa sobre a vida, se a senhora n\u00e3o me explica? Se \u00e9 paciente, maia, n\u00e3o te posso explicar tudo de uma vez. Ah, vamos ter com as outras. Ah. E dentro dos favos colocam-se os ovos. E por que que fazem isso? Os ovos ficam dentro de favos e passadas algumas semanas nasce uma abilhinha, como aconteceu contigo? Esteve no oven com aquelas? Esteves-te. Ve como elas colocam o oven cada buraquinho. Depois v\u00eam outra abalha que faz o barificio conhecer. S\u00f3 as obreiras s\u00f3 trabalham dentro da comemeia. S\u00e3o elas que constranhe a comemeia e tomam conta dos ovos. Tenho sempre muito que fazer isso. Todos os dias a abalha a mestre, foi um grande n\u00famero de ovos. N\u00e3o me parece que te lembre-se de como era quando estabas dentro do ovo, pois n\u00e3o. Ah! Onde \u00e9 que ser\u00e1 aquela me usa? Ah! \u00c9 pesado! Acique! Ah, est\u00e1s a\u00ed! Est\u00e1 a afir professor a Cassandra tamb\u00e9m consigo! \u00d3timo, mas \u00e9 s\u00f3 um ovo por cada buraquinho. Mas por que? Se os ovos ficassem aos pares, podiam falar-nos com os outros. Assim j\u00e1 n\u00e3o sentiam t\u00e3o sozinhos. Maia, n\u00f3s as abalhas n\u00e3o nascemos para conversar, nascemos para trabalhar. Estou muito preocupada com o tico, tem umas ideias muito estranhas nessa cabecinha. Eu gosto de minha ideia, dois ovos em vez de um. Minha crida, Maia, a experi\u00eancia prova que \u00e9 melhor um ovo. Mas diga-l\u00e1 porque que \u00e9 melhor? Fazimos divis\u00f5es maiores para mais ovos. Anda, vamos l\u00e1. Ah, que bem que cheira! Ah! Que fome! E \u00e9 mesmo bom o cheiro que est\u00e1s a sentir \u00e9 do mel. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Por que consigo matar e fazer outras? Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Deixa isso, \u00e9 muito pesado para ti. Estou a mel! Sim, \u00e9 que que armazenamos o mel. Maia, voltar aqui e j\u00e1. Estou \u00e9 de meioso! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ahuk! Ahuk! Ahuk! Agora que j\u00e1 s\u00e3o mais crescidos, v\u00e1-lo de v\u00e1lv\u00e1-los numa viagem ao mundo exterior pra ver em o c\u00e9u. Professor Acacandra, pode dizer-me que \u00e9 o c\u00e9u que estava de saber. Espera at\u00e9 l\u00e1 chegarmos depois explico de tudo, mas n\u00e3o penses que o mundo l\u00e1 fora \u00e9 s\u00f3 divers\u00e3o? As abalhas pequeninas n\u00e3o podem dar l\u00e1 fora s\u00f3zinho e perceber-se-te? Ah... Ah... O mundo l\u00e1 fora \u00e9 perigoso, tendo perceber como \u00e9 cruel de ter muito cuidado. Se eu sei, Professor Acacandra, eu j\u00e1 n\u00e3o est\u00e1 l\u00e1 dois anos. Ent\u00e3o deve saber que isto \u00e9 uma vez, peguei em mim, desenho de piores, dez vezes, meios do que n\u00f3s, tenham muito cuidado com eles. N\u00e3o tenham me devolta em pr\u00f3is voces lugares. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 vezes para os dentes da com\u00e9ia, elas n\u00e3o podem entrar, por isso n\u00e3o precisam de ter medo de nenhum, minhas pequeninas. Isto \u00e9 uma ra... Nunca voa e muito baixo sobre a \u00e1gua. Se n\u00e3o, isto \u00e9 o que pode acontecer. Ela esteu uma l\u00edngua muito comprida. N\u00e3o se preocupa e as reas nunca poder\u00e3o entrar aqui. Ah... Professor Acacandra... Isso quer dizer que nunca nos devemos aproximar das reas? Isso mesmo, h\u00edly, n\u00e3o se esque\u00e7am. Tu \u00e9 o h\u00edly. Sim, sou h\u00edly. Para deixar muito esp\u00e9rito... N\u00e3o, eu j\u00e1 n\u00e3o est\u00e1 l\u00e1 dois anos. Bem, eu sou a Maya. J\u00e1 eu viste falar de mim. Sim, mas s\u00f3 coisas terr\u00edveis. Faz muitas perguntas \u00e0s pessoas que eles davam estar de gritar. O mundo pode ser muito cruel. Por exemplo, quando chove n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada agrad\u00e1vel. Quando isso acontecer, voltam para casa, os condosso debaste de uma f\u00e3. Se estiver a chover l\u00e1 fora, qual \u00e9 a melhor coisa que uma abalha pode fazer? Quer cheirar a sua responder, h\u00edly? Bem, tivemos ficar em casa. O que \u00e9 que aconteceria se n\u00e3o fic\u00e1smos em casa, professor? Eu que aboio de vos dizer, crida. Que barulho \u00e9 este? Por favor, n\u00e3o saiam dos voces lugares e eu volto j\u00e1. O que \u00e9 que estar\u00e1 a acontecer? Deve haver algum problema? Maya, Maya, Maya, onde \u00e9 que vais? Volta! Volta aqui! Volar fora! N\u00e3o, Maya. Maya, volta! N\u00e3o \u00e9 seguro ir l\u00e1 para fora! O que est\u00e3o? O que est\u00e3o a fazer? \u00c9 meu! N\u00e3o \u00e9... Am\u00e9m! Est\u00e1 em cedo para a ca\u00e7ada. N\u00e3o \u00e9... Tudo \u00e9 que vai ver esse pote. O que est\u00e1 a passar aqui? Pronto, n\u00e3o s\u00f3 desmagem, pequeninha. O h\u00edly, tu \u00e9 o mais velho. V\u00ea l\u00e1 sempre for em alguma ordem. Voc\u00ea j\u00e1 ouviram que o bicho \u00e9 respons\u00e1vel? Passa o que eu digo! Olha, uma fiesta! N\u00e3o \u00e9 uma vez para a s\u00e9rie, \u00e9 aquela que vimos antes. Essa \u00e9 uma figura, mas j\u00e1 que sou respons\u00e1vel, vou mostrar outra coisa. Isto \u00e9 uma hora, n\u00e3o \u00e9? N\u00e3o \u00e9? E tamb\u00e9m por ligosas. Eu j\u00e1 vi uma s\u00e9rie, chamava Marta e era mesmo uma. Ah, em sabitira! N\u00e3o, n\u00e3o \u00e9? Isto \u00e9 um dentro do li\u00e3o. N\u00e3o, n\u00e3o \u00e9, n\u00e3o s\u00f3 cheio. Eu vamos va'\u0441\u0442\u0438, vamos. O que fiento t\u00e3o forte que sobra l\u00e1 fora? N\u00e3o \u00e9 mesmo nada agrad\u00e1vel. O seu j\u00e1 n\u00e3o \u00e9 s\u00f3. A professora Cassandra diz que era s\u00f3. E a\u00ed? Voc\u00ea funciona? Voc\u00ea est\u00e1 aqui? Ai, tu sou da Cassandra. Elima, o que que tu est\u00e1s a fazer? Voc\u00ea deveria estar suzca dino e estudar. Obrigada, Elima. E pode desvolter para teu lugar. Maya, \u00e9 capaz de me dizer o que \u00e9 isto? Mas onde \u00e9 que ela est\u00e1? Algu\u00e9m me sabe dizer onde \u00e9 que ela est\u00e1? Algu\u00e9m viu sair? Sim, professora. Eu vi a sair. Foi exatamente por onde ela foi, foi ver o tempo est\u00e1-de. Mas o que cria-se t\u00e3o travessa? Tem de estar sempre a vigiar aquela rapariga. Um mundo est\u00e1 outra vez lindo.

        "translated": "The story that I'm going to tell That is a skirt of magic and color And an old woman will talk About nature and its tendencies I ask the illusion, wasn't it Maiar In the world the infantry came out Maiar I will always roast It continues to enchant, it is always The insert uses the Maiar lard Maiar her friends adventure Maiia became pain Maiia, maiia, maiia It's to connect, a whole esumen, maiia Oh, ah, ah! Oh, there friends, as you can see? I'm a grasshopper My name is Felipe, I hope you like me I know I'm weird, but where to get used to it Come here often I don't know who I'll be What is there to tell you The agenda nothing interesting happened to me But if I know that the life of a grasshopper can be very boring Spending the day eating, eating and robbing air from side to side It's not very chatty, although I like to eat Ah, ah, ah! Gustava, if the butterfly were my friend It's a bee's nest and a bee's nest It brings honey Those little ones are so hard-working that they think they even work too much I'm always going to collect Ah, ah! Ah! A very beautiful collector today, I gave a little drop Ah, it's just like them, always busy all day long They don't even have time to say, oh there, how atypical Until they drop their foot Ah, ah, ah! Why did they come back so soon? I'm going to stay much longer But why? What could happen? This buzz is not at all ordinary Maybe we'll be lucky and something interesting will happen Hello, my little one Will you go for a walk? Do you know how to talk? No, I don't think you know how to talk And you're still very young The only thing you know how to do is open your mouth Until I'm hungry I know, there must be trouble in the hive It's on the other side of the ruined castle Behind that big rock It's a safe and pleasant place What's going on? Why don't you let me in? You don't know who I am. If the safe doesn't taste like blood, you can't come in. I don't need blood, Cassandra. It was the voice of the teacher when I was in school. Uh oh. Uh oh. What's going on? Why don't you let me in? You don't know who I am. If the safe doesn't taste like blood, you can't come in. Hmm, hmm, hmm. I don't need blood, Cassandra. It was the voice of the teacher when I was in school. Uh oh. O? O? O? Today is the big birthday. If you don't let me in, all you little morr\u00e3os. Look at people carefully before you say you don't know them. We are very sorry, but we have rules to follow. There are many people who try to come in to cause trouble, and we are the ones who are responsible. One should have enough common sense to change the rules at a time as important as this. Never stop to think, you fool. If we only knew it was that important. And now, can I come in? If the safe doesn't taste like blood, you fool. We've been waiting for a long time, they must be almost playing. Here they come, come on. We're leaving here. We're leaving here. How are you from here? Are you from here? It's... It's Maia. The need to break up. Hello, is anyone home? Yes, half. We've been waiting for you here. Last strength in Asia. Who's Maia? I'm Maia. Why did you call me Maia? Call me as a favor. Ah... Well, actually, there's no special reason. Everyone has the name. Ah... Do you have the name too? Swarm the house. Take care of you all the big ones. Come here. It's a good thing I trust you, it's hot. Excuse me, the others left a long time ago. Why live so long? I had a beautiful dream. A dream, but Maia, birds never dream. Maybe one day he'll tell you my dream was so fun. Well, I'm just bored with the house, come here, fish. Wait, I'm going to fish you. Calm down, stop. Your life is just beginning and there's so much to learn. Oh! What am I doing? I'm learning to live in a swarm. Swarm? What's that? Bees always swarm. Why? It's a little hard to understand. First I'll teach you some easier things. Why do they do that? We bees have been doing this since we insisted. And why do bees do that? Why what name? Cassandra, do you want to know why? How am I supposed to learn anything about life if you don't explain it to me? If you're patient, Maia, I can't explain everything to you at once. Oh, let's go to the others. Oh. And inside the honeycomb, the eggs are laid. And why do they do that? The eggs stay inside the honeycomb and after a few weeks a little bee hatches, like what happened to you? Have you been in the oven with those? You have. See how they put the oven in every little hole. Then another bee comes along and makes the barnyard know. Only the workers only work inside the hive. They are the ones who keep the hive in check and take care of the eggs. I always have a lot to do that. Every day, the master bee lays a large number of eggs. I don't think you remember what it was like when you were inside the egg, do you? Oh! Where could that be? Oh! It's heavy! Aceque! Oh, there you are! Cassandra is saying the same thing to me, teacher! Great, but it's only one egg for each little hole. But why? If the eggs were in pairs, they could talk to each other. That way they wouldn't feel so alone. Maia, we birds weren't born to talk, we were born to work. I'm very worried about you, you have some very strange ideas in your little head. I like my idea, two eggs instead of one. My dear, Maia, experience proves that one egg is better. But tell me, why is it better? We make bigger divisions for more eggs. Come on, let's go. Oh, how good it smells! Oh! I'm so hungry! And the smell you're smelling is really good, it's honey. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Why can I kill and make others? Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Leave it, it's too heavy for you. I'm honey! Yes, that's how we store the honey. Maia, come back here now. I'm so excited! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ahuk! Ahuk! Ahuk! Now that they're older, let's take them on a trip to the outside world to see the sky. Professor Acacandra, you can tell me that it's the sky that I wanted to know. Wait until we get there, then I'll explain everything, but don't you think that the outside world is just fun? Can't little bees go outside alone and understand each other? Ah... Ah... The outside world is dangerous, and you have to realize how cruel it is to be very careful. If I know, Professor Acacandra, I haven't been there for two years. So you should know that this is once, I took it upon myself, drawing of ten times worse means than us, be very careful with them. Don't have me back in your places. There are no times for the comet's teeth, they can't get in, so you don't need to be afraid of any, my little ones. This is a frog... It never flies and very low over the water. If not, this is what might happen. She has a very long tongue. Don't worry, and the areas will never be able to come in here. Oh... Professor Acacandra... Does that mean we should never go near the areas? That's right, H\u00edly, don't forget. You're H\u00edly. Yes, I'm H\u00edly. To make things very funny... No, I haven't been there for two years. Well, I'm Maya. You've heard me mentioned. Yes, but only terrible things. Ask people so many questions that they'd scream. The world can be very cruel. For example, when it rains, it's not at all pleasant. When that happens, they go home, the condominiums of a fan. If it's raining outside, what's the best thing a bee can do? Do you want to smell your answer, H\u00edly? Well, we had to stay home. What would happen if we didn't stay home, professor? I'll tell you, girl. What's that noise? Please stay put and I'll be right back. What's going on? There must be some problem? Maya, Maya, Maya, where are you going? Come back! Come back here! Go back out! No, Maya. Maya, come back! It's not safe to go out there! What are you? What are you doing? It's mine! It's not... Amen! It's too early for the hunt. It's not... Everyone is going to see that pot. What's going on here? Okay, not just me, little one. Hey, you're the oldest. Always go there somewhere. order. Have you ever heard that the animal is responsible? Pass on what I say! Look, a party! It's not once for the series, it's the one we saw before. This is a figure, but since I'm responsible, I'll show you something else. This is an hour, isn't it? Isn't it? And also for ligosas. I've already seen a series, it was called Marta and it really was one. Ah, in sabitira! No, isn't it? This is one inside the lion. No, it's not, not just full. Let's go, let's go. What's so strong that's left out there? It's really not nice at all. Yours is not alone anymore. Teacher Cassandra says it was alone. What's up? Do you work? Are you here? Oh, you're Cassandra's. Elima, what are you doing? You should be suzca dino and studying. Thank you, Elima. And you can go back to your place. Maya, can you tell me what this is? But where is she? Can anyone tell me where she is? Did anyone see her leave? Yes, teacher. I saw her leave. That's exactly where she went, to see what the weather was like. But what's making her so naughty? You have to keep an eye on that girl all the time. The world is beautiful again. How funny that green O\u5e03 Xing is!

But I didn't do anything wrong, I just want to watch the storm! I don't care about causing myself a lot of trouble. People, I think a lot of trouble! People, I'm sorry! And don't go out to explore the world again. Okay? People, I'm sorry! Come on, stop being so clumsy and try to get some sleep. Why are you naughty? Just because you want to see the world outside. Hmm, up, you see, they'll be smarter and run away when no one is looking. Never choose to find me."

De haberla recolectar miel, no es un juego. Una vez nada es peda\u00f1o. Nada deber\u00edamos probar. \u00a1Mmm! \u00a1Festa tan rica! Si tujarra est\u00e1 llena, no importa probar un poco. \u00a1S\u00e1r un poquito! \u00a1Esta flor! \u00bfCu\u00e1l es especialmente bien? Creo que basta.

Dios m\u00edo, lo que pesa, tendr\u00e9 que descansar un poco. \u00a1Ay, mi jarras de miel! \u00a1Ya rabitase! \u00a1No mide de repente! \u00a1Soy una oruba y no una ramita! \u00a1Eres un bicarrorocho! Bueno, es que la peque\u00f1a Maya se ha cansado tan pronto. \u00bfY qui\u00e9n se est\u00e1 riendo de m\u00ed? \u00bfA qui\u00e9n dijo mi nom? \u00a1Y soy yo! Me he tomado la libertad de re\u00edrme de mi peque\u00f1a amiga. No tengo asmiedos, soy flip, es altamonte, si tu buen amigo. Te conozco muy bien, Maya. Conozco a m\u00ed, t\u00fa, \u00bfd\u00f3nde est\u00e1s? Aqu\u00ed arriba, en la hoja. \u00bfNo podr\u00edas gustarte que tambi\u00e9n rasme hablar? Y ahora dime que me conocen.

S\u00ed. \u00a1Ah! \u00bfY supongo que para ti es normal saltar como un loco cuando hablas con alguien? No, es una costumbre, por eso se en el saltamonte. Me paso la vida saltando y comiendo y me divierto, serbando a los dem\u00e1s y me lo pas\u00f3 en grande. Pues eso no est\u00e1 bien. No te enfades prometo ayudarte cuando tengas dificultades. Estoy seguro de que las tendr\u00e1s siendo como eres tan curiosa y tan impartidente. \u00a1Hasta la vista! \u00a1Pereo un momento! Caberno, loco no es alta. \u00bfQu\u00e9 conflicto el m\u00edo? \u00bfDeber\u00edan hacer las jarras de m\u00ed con una tapadera y tapo la que no se salga?

Pero no sirve de nada recoger tanta como lo hizo Maya porque la jarras se vuelve tan pesada que es muy dif\u00edcil llevarlo. No se puede aprender todo en un d\u00eda que a Sandra deber\u00edas saber muy bien eso. No se gan\u00f3 Zamora en una hora. Las cosas necesitan su tiempo. Y no olvid\u00e9is que cuando vol\u00e9is hay que tener mucho cuidado con la ara\u00f1a y su tela. La ara\u00f1a es nuestro peor enemigo. \u00bfHab\u00e9is deshidomado otra vez? O en cuanto la pierdo de vista se va. \u00a1Est\u00e1 volando, Pere\u00edn! Tiene muchos p\u00e1jaros en la cabeza.

Now, Maya's gonna fly! Whoops! Oh! I'm sorry... Can't you watch where you're going? Yeah, he wanted to, really nervous because they're going to let me fly for the first time. Let's see. Is this it, Pendo? And you know what, I'm gonna fly straight into the sun. Tala, la la la! Maya's going! That little girl's gullible! But I remember my first flight very well. My goodness! It's been so long now! We don't want to fool you! Now, let's fly! Now, fly! Now, fly! Stop, stop! That's my... Tell me, are you Willy, eh? No, I'm Maya Oh, I thought you were Willy! Go on, go on, go on, beche What's the matter with Willy? Nothing, nothing, just keep going, little one. Okay, okay. Ah, ah! Well, you're here. Do you think you were looking forward to flying? And I am. But first I had to tell everyone that today I'm gonna fly for the first time. Hey, give me my wings now! I'll turn, look, how they shine! Come on, kids, let's start Ah, ah! Maybe it's a little low, don't you think? Come on, Maya, you try it Very well Help! Help, help! Oh, I'm breaking! Oops! That always happens when you try to fly too high Ah! Carraro! Someone's missing here, isn't Willy? No! How funny! Because he didn't come with us to flying lessons Do you know why he's not here, young lady? He might be sick Hey! Maya! Go brighter and they'll fly us away They're gone, Willy What? Then why did he come back? Why? Why didn't they feel like flying? That's not true, you don't fool me You were crazy about flying, much more than us It's my fault, for via By my God left behind Because I can't fly that's not it? Isn't it true? You didn't stay here for me? And what does it matter what I stayed for? Don't you want them to tell you? You didn't know, right? You knew I was afraid of flying? Because I don't know why I came back What idea are you putting in your head? It's not that I came That I don't know how to fly? It's that I don't know? And he went to check he saw the sabegas is right One friend the most precious treasure Now we are pruning to withdraw Or so I'm going to be in the ab for a month If not yet, it's again There's no sausage He didn't see maya with them Didn't the sabegas see off? Of course After this there's for the diss Vlad\u00edas This is going to make him look twice, ma'am. We atamotes are smart guys. What rudeness? When you stop it is mortal when you are talking to a lady. Oh, you don't understand me my dear lady. I have hot blood and a lot of temper. Oh, and our little magic must have done some of hers already! She's charming but maybe she got very stuck that one... Greno, good! Now a little police soup! No, no, no. This will give you strength to wait to fly. I can't eat any more, very reinvented. More, more, more, mistress! Can you have another silver of soup? Come on? Will you open your mouth? And, but I can't eat anything else! I'm beginning to feel sick and very heavy. What's the matter, Willis? Are you not feeling well? Oh, my belly is so full it will burst! Why is your belly so full? Oh, Maya I thought you didn't take so many to fly. No! And I had to cooperate with all that. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh... Maya. Oh, my little friend is coming! Good morning for your first good one, or Maya! Are you so worried that you can't even hear me? Good, Willis! Must the flowers be here? They're not wonderful! Good morning, flowers! I'm Maya! Maya! Maya, where are you! Yes, come on, young lady, getting married! I'll be with you often! It's very hard work to pick me up! Oh, oh! No! It's all the same flower, no! Oh, oh, oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! This must be a bud! This is my bud! It doesn't come out here, it comes out! Hitting good people's heads with a honey pot! It was already by accident! Hello, there's someone right there! Watch out, I'm sick of jars! If there is honey, it's not a game. Once nothing is a small thing. We shouldn't try anything. Mmm! Such a nice party! If your jar is full, it doesn't matter if I try a little. Just a little! This flower! Which one is especially good? I think that's enough. If I pick more, it's over the jar. Nobody told me it was so so. Oh! My God, how heavy it is, I'll have to rest a little. Oh, my honey jars! I'm already a rabit! It doesn't measure suddenly! I'm a honeybee and not a twig! You're a little rooster! Well, it's just that little Maya got tired so quickly. And who's laughing at me? Who did she say my name to? And it's me! I've taken the liberty of laughing at my little friend. I'm not afraid, I'm flip, it's highland, yes your good friend. I know you very well, Maya. I know me, you, where are you? Up here, on the leaf. Wouldn't you like me to talk too? And now tell me that they know me. I've known you since the day you came out of the honeycomb. What? Since I was born? Yes. Oh! And I suppose it's normal for you to jump like crazy when you talk to someone? No, it's a habit, that's why I'm a grasshopper. I spend my life jumping and eating and I have fun, servile others and I had a great time. Well, that's not right. Don't be angry, I promise to help you when you have difficulties. I'm sure you will have them being as curious and impartial as you are. See you later! But wait a minute! Damn, crazy isn't tall. What's my problem? Should they make my jars with a lid and I cover the one that doesn't come out? Well, well. Have you learned to pick it up, my? Did you have a good time? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes! But it's no use picking up as much as Maya did because the jars become so heavy that it's very difficult to carry them. You can't learn everything in one day, which Sandra should know very well. well that. Zamora was not won in an hour. Things need his time. And don't forget that when you fly you have to be very careful with the spider and its web. The spider is our worst enemy. Have you dehydrated again? Or as soon as I lose sight of her she leaves. It's flying, Pere\u00edn! He has many birds in his head. Look how everything moves in the store. Maya! Maya, no one half so! This girl, she is she! This and here, miss, fuck me! And Maya! Hey! Hey! Well, straight into the spider web! Maya, Maya, Maya! And at the moment you must be careful with the spider web, but of course as always you had been somewhere else. Maya, oh, stay here! Where are you? Oh, Maya! Oh, here! Stop being stupid! But yes! Oh, Maya! Bid! Leave me, leave me! Maya! Oh! This music, it's fun! That? You are your affliction! Do you realize the danger you have run? No, what's wrong with you? And haven't you seen the spider web? And what, have you already grieved? I'm not your teacher anymore, ask, Miss Casanda told you. Very! Now, now, now! Now, now! What should I ask you, Miss Cassandra? What's calling, thank you? Maya! Well, here we are again. Slow down, don't throw away the honey! Careful, let's go! Oh, oh! She had covered so much skin and she could already see it! Now, now! I'm not going to let them re-run my, I'll fill my face through. I have no desire. There was! There was! There was! There was! Murchante, Martana! Murchante, Martana! I was! I was! Want that. Oh, my thing, what has happened to me now? Why can't I fly like this all of a sudden? Miss, miss, where is she? Miss, what's another one, miss? What is a man from where he is he? And... Miss, miss, it's Andra! I can't fly anymore or what am I going to do and what will happen when it gets dark. Baby, baby! Teque\u00f1a, Maya, that face is coming! Flip, it's you! No! You got your wings wet! I hate that guy! They face each other while we jump. What if I fall? Hadar, strong time! I'm going to pawn my longest highs, a two, three, me, me, me, me! Oh! Yes, this is fantastic! This is fendo! Oh, what a cut, and Alberto the wind! Ah, they are! Oh, yes, yes, they are, they are! And no, Maya! No no no! Oh, stop, stop, stop! You're fine now! Your adas have been removed, Maya. Yes, yes, nothing can do like before, Flip. What are you going to tell your teacher when she asks you why you've been out there for so long? Hey, hey, hey! Now, now, now! I'm afraid I won't be able to help you with that, you'll have to solve it on your own. Uhh! See you around! Now, now, here! Bye bye! Little Maya never gets tired of flying. She would like to fly high, very high until she reaches the sun. In the next episode, baby Maya no, no, no, no, no, I'm not going to tell you anything. But I assure you that it will be a fun and exciting story. So, friends? Bye bye! Bye bye!"

SprichensINGING Juli davon, Intervent ist es bei mir, sehen wir against Intervent es hier\u4fddiary Bruch alles calam, Grindel- holen Na wie weit sind Sie Mr. Wodjas? Gleich fertig Mrs. Kirin. Gut. Jot. Jot. Mach dich doch bitte schon fertig. Und vielleicht r\u00e4umt es auch dein Zimmer, ob sie m\u00fcssen jeden Moment hier sein. Wie weit ist es noch schon? Vielleicht noch eine Meile. Vom Bahnhof aus dem W\u00e4hrendgef\u00e4hrd 5 Meilen gefahren. Ist ja nicht zu laut, um endlich geht's mal weg ab. Ist ja auch sch\u00f6n hier was? Ja, ja, toll noch. Oh, guck doch mal das Meer. Das da dr\u00fcben ist bestimmt k\u00f6nnen, Einen. Oh ja, m\u00fcsste sein, will. Was sind das von komischer Toem? Keine Ahnung. Aber Ginny wei\u00df das bestimmt. Na, so wollen wir nicht ins P\u00fcnktlich sein. Jot. Jodina. Also wirklich, Jodina. Jodina, komm hier. Das muss es sein. Los. Entschuldeln Sie bitte. Ist das die Kirin Cottage? Wieso wirst du das wissen? Wir sind verwandte von Jodina. Ihre Mutter hat uns eingeladen. Und die Lausebande hat Professor Kirin noch gef\u00e4llt. Und drei mehr, die herum Wimmeln leer machen und den bei der Arbeit st\u00f6ren. Er hat verdammt es Gl\u00fcck, dass er meistens auf der Insel ist. Dann hat er wohl diesen komischen Toem gebaut. Ja, etwas mit seinem Experiment zu tun. Ist aber streng geheim klar. Also seht euch vor und blaue dort nicht mit fremden Leuten dar\u00fcber. Und lasst euch ja nicht in einem meiner Gem\u00fcsebilder mich. Die \u00dcberbetter, wo f\u00fcr \u00e4lter uns denn f\u00fcr Kanickl. Ach, der seid ihr ja. Ist aber sch\u00f6n euch mal wieder zu sehen. Tachpante Fanny. Hier seid ihr auch schon ein bisschen Zeit, ich euch das letzte Mal gesehen hab. End war damals noch ein Baby. Wartet mal. Du m\u00fcsstest Julien sein und das ist dick. Na wie war die Reise? Einfach klasse Tante Fanny. Die Fahrt vom Bahnhof hierher war doch prima. Na gut. Ich hab beim Bahnhof angerufen. Euer Gepeck wird hergebracht. Stell die Fahrer hinter das Haus. Gleich gibt's Tee. Ihr habt doch bestimmt auch Hunger. Ich stell ja gerade rein. Wenn Beine vom Rad gefallen. Besonders Ende. Was so sprach, dass sie sich immer den Kopf gehalten hat. Der fehlt irgendwie wieder Mine. Ich w\u00fcrde sagen, ihr habt schon gesagt, dass ihr seid f\u00fcr die Herkaufheit. Und jetzt mal noch die Bahnhof und Warte f\u00fcr die H\u00e4lfte. Wunderbarer nachmittag. Wunderbarer nachmittag. Ja, ich muss ja sagen, Mr. Johnson. Ich hoffe, sie haben gut gespeisert. Das ist aber, es wurde nur ein bisschen zu viel geriert. Es wird Zeit f\u00fcr eine sch\u00f6ne Tasse B\u00fcro-Tee. Oh je. Ja. Ja. Miss Peters, ich muss umfache gesehen auf Weise f\u00fcr ein paar Tage wegfahren. Ich bin sicher, der Minister wird bis zu meiner R\u00fcckkehr auch ohne mich auskommen. Wir lassen Sie bitte den Wagen vorfahren, Miss Peters. Ja, Mr. Johnson. Dankesch\u00f6n. Ich hab mir gedacht, morgen fahren wir alle auf die Insel und essen zu Mittag mit Onkel Quentin. Klasse! Wo ist ein Georginier-Tamte-Fan meet? Wir haben uns schon so auf sie gefreut. Was auch nicht fursist. Also George verschwindet immer gerade dann, wenn sie es nicht soll. Aber wie so nenst du sie George? Sie will es so. Aber jeder denkt an sie ist ein Junge und kein M\u00e4dchen. Anschein, wer sie es nicht anders. Also ich m\u00f6chte nicht, dass man denkt, ich w\u00e4re ein Junge. Nein, nat\u00fcrlich nicht. Aber du bist ja auch nicht wie George. Ach, dass du dich auch mal sehen l\u00e4sst. Wir haben fast alles aufgegessen. Ich hab kein Hunger, danke Mutter. Willst du nicht guten Tag sagen? Das sind End, Dick und Julian. Hallo. Tag. Hallo. Hallo. Warum gehst du nicht mit Ihnen raus, George? Und zeig sie ein bisschen die Gegend. Aber ich muss doch noch. Ja, was? Was musst du? Nichts. Dann ist es sehr gut. Also ab mit euch. Ich r\u00e4ume den Tisch ab. Danke f\u00fcr den Tentefenn. Der wohne ich war auch ganz viel Spa\u00df, Kinder. H\u00f6rt mal. Kommt nicht zu sp\u00e4t zur\u00fcck. Nein, nein. Tentefenni hat gesagt, wir wurden auf Anglckwent ins Insel fahren. Ich muss das nicht klassisch hatten. Mein Name ist nicht George. Ich hei\u00dfe George. Und die Insel geh\u00f6rt nicht ihm, sondern mir. Was riegst du dich denn gleich auf? Sie geh\u00f6rt mir. Er hat sie mir geschenkt. Und jetzt arbeitet ihr da und l\u00e4sst mich \u00fcberhaupt nicht mehr hin. Aber wenn seine Arbeit ein gro\u00dfes Geheimnis ist, warum macht er sie dann an einem Ort, wo jeder hinkommen kann, wenn er will? Du kannst es ja mal versuchen, die Klippen vor der Insel machen aus deinem Boot Kleinholz. Nur Vater und ich wissen, wie man da durchkommt. Er ist dort, weil die Gezeiten f\u00fcr seine Experimente braucht. Deshalb ist er auf meiner Insel. Also das finde ich auch prima meiner eigenen Insel zuh\u00f6rt. H\u00f6rt mal. Ich hab jetzt was zu erledigen. Das geht nur mich, was an Verstanden. Also komm, mir blo\u00df nicht hinterher geschlichen. Keiner von euch. Wie haben wir's bei uns zu tun? Was kann ja lustig werden mit dir? Na f\u00fcr euch ist es ja nicht weiter schlimmer, aber ich muss mit ihr in einem Zimmer schlafen. Ich sage euch, das werden bestimmt zwei Verdammt lang gewohnt. Ja, ich bin ja auch noch ein paar Wochen. Darf ich ihn noch eins bringen? Warum nicht, wenn sie es bezahlen kann? Oh, das w\u00e4r mir ein Vergl\u00fcgen. Bitte? Danke. Jimmy! Jimmy! Und komm, Jimmy, komm, na los, komm! Na komm, mein Kleiner, ach, Jimmy! Das ist die Kleine von Quentin Kirin, nicht wahr? Ja. Die ist wild als ein Junge. Und die meisten hier sagen nur George zu ihr zum Wohl. Zum Wohl. Das da ist ihr Hund. Der Professe wollte den Hund nicht im Haus haben. Sie sollte ihn weggeben, aber an dem K\u00f6ther h\u00e4ngt sie mehr als ein Allmandern. Das ist ein Sibhoist, Quentin, jetzt. Ich hab ihn lange nicht mehr gesehen. Ah, hat sich fast v\u00f6llig auf die Insel zur\u00fcckgezogen, experimentiert. Da kommt \u00fcberhaupt nicht mehr r\u00fcber. Seine Frau bringt alles, was er braucht zur Insel r\u00fcber. Vorher muss er bei mir erst signalisieren, dass alles in Ordnung ist. Dann blinkt er dreimal vom Tour mit einer Taschenlappe. Jeden Morgen und jeden Abend um 11. Danach k\u00f6nnen sie ihre Urstellen. Jeder hat seine Marotten. Ist das nicht verr\u00fcckt, so viel zu arbeiten? Los, komm, hier gef\u00e4llt's mir. Wenn sich George innen nur nicht sofort bl\u00f6d ben\u00e4hen wurde, sagt los, George zu ihr. Und zuletzt oben muss man das Eis bezahlen. Das sagst du nur, weil ich so eine Sofa-Leber um. MAYORn! Wie sieht dir Abbesiereinsam aus? Das sieht sensual<|la|> Campbell Hirle. Da kann man nicht viel sehen. Ich konnte juegosd quality alive! Wir k\u00f6nnen auch nicht ohne Taschenland bereingehen. Gute, gehen wir zur\u00fcck und holen uns eine. Daf\u00fcr reicht die Zeit nicht. Wiss dir, was wir kommen morgen noch mal hier und untersuchen sie dann? Klar, die l\u00e4uft uns ja nicht weg. Bewartet mal. Wir behalten das aber f\u00fcr uns, ja? George hat hier geheimnis und diese H\u00f6hel ist nur unser Geheimnis. Okay? Okay. Oh, hallo Kinder. Ihr seid doch zu Besuch auf Karen Cutt jetzt, nicht wahr? Ja, das stimmt. Ist George nicht mitgekommen? Nein. Oh ja, Onkel und Eure Tante sind gute Freunde von mir. Wollt ihr morgen nicht bei mir Tee trinken? Na ja, ich wei\u00df noch nicht, was wir machen. Na ja, ist der egal, kommt von ihr lustig ab. Ich will mich freuen. Wiedersehen. Komischer Couts. Das f\u00fcr mich, hier nur so von merkw\u00fcrdigen Leuten. Habte Fendi ist der einzig normale Mensch, der mir hier bisher begegnet ist. Onkel Quentin scheint ja wohl auch ein bisschen komisch zu sein. Ja, das werden wir morgen feststellen, wenn wir r\u00fcberfahren auf die Insel nicht wahr. Darf ich hoh dann, George? Nein, die Klippen f\u00fchlt sich ja gerne, aber abliehen da auf jeden Fall. Das ist ja nicht so, dass wir uns nicht so gut haben. Ja, das werden wir morgen feststellen, wenn wir r\u00fcberfahren auf die Insel nicht wahr. Ja, ob ich hoh dann, George? Nein, die Klippen f\u00fchlt sich ja gerne, aber abliehen da auf jeden Fall. Das ist doch so, dass du sie zu gehen kannst. Das ist doch so. Da sieht's ein Kind aus. Wie geht's? Vater! Das ist bei einem Handschrankton, der h\u00e4nge? Nein. In denen rufen kommt, da kommt's. Das ist doch so, dass du sie zu gehen kannst. Das ist doch so, dass du sie zu gehen kannst. Vater! Vater! Das ist bei einem Handschrankton, der h\u00e4nge? Nein, in denen rufen kommt, der meiste zu fahren. George nimmt die Jungs mit und seht, ob ihr ihn findet. Okay, komm! Ich wollte schon noch sie essen. Vater! Vater! Nein, zu was habe ich ja noch nie gesehen? Sieht euch das an! Sag mal, George, wei\u00dft du, was das f\u00fcr Dinger sind da oben am Tor? Ich k\u00f6nnte mir vorstellen, dass das irgendwas mit Sonnenenergie zu tun hat. Die Reflektoren oder wieder, das hei\u00dft, stehen vielleicht beannahs. Vater! Vater! Ihr ist f\u00fchlen nicht da oben. Irgendwo muss er doch sein. Hier bin ich. Ihr ist f\u00fchlen nicht da oben. Irgendwo muss er doch sein. Hier bin ich! Prof. K\u00f6rin, Ihre Insel scheint ja ziemlich aufmerksamkeit zu erregen. Du bist gewachsen seit dem letzten Mal. Das war vor acht Jahren angek\u00f6nnt. Ach wirklich? Dann war es ja wohl zu erwarten oder was meinst du? Wo treibst du dich denn im Moment auf der Insel rum? In den Kellern. In den Kellern? Unter den Ruinen, die Keller vom alten Schloss. Sag mal, ist das dein Geheimlerboor? Ja, wenn man will, kann man so nennen. K\u00f6nnen wir sich George auch anst\u00e4ndig haben? Sie hat uns rausgerudert, um die gef\u00e4hrlichen Kleppen rum. Alle Achtung, die kann rudern. Das ist alles in jungen, wei\u00dft du? So, jetzt muss ich erst mal zur\u00fcck. Ich hab dann auch was zu kontrollieren. Danke f\u00fcr den Nachschub. George, du kannst deine Insel bald zur\u00fcck haben. Ich bin so gut wie fertig. Und wer gehst die Signale nicht? Ich mach mir sonst auch. Nein, ich denke dran. Haben wir sie jetzt euch noch gut? Also dann. Wiedersehen. Wiedersehen. Sie da, Sie da. Eine reizende \u00dcberraschung, Sie wie dazu sehen k\u00f6nnten. Johnson. Ich nehme an, Sie beobachten seltene Wasserf\u00f6gel nicht wahr? Was f\u00fcr ein hervorragendes Teleskop. Ja, das ist ein ausgezeichnetes Fernrohr. Ach so sagen Sie mir f\u00fcr wen arbeiten Sie denn diesmal? Russland, China, Amerika? Damals als wir uns das letzte Mal beliegneten waren Sie f\u00fcr uns sehr unbequien k\u00fcrten. Ich hoffe, dass Sie sich dar\u00fcber klar sind. H\u00f6ren Sie, ich arbeite f\u00fcr niemanden. Ich kippe Ihnen mein Wort. Ihr Wort. Ach, wenn das kein Funkger\u00e4t ist, will ich sofort tot umfallen. So, das reicht. Legt eure Schwimm\u00f6sten rein. So und du tr\u00e4gst das. So, krank Kinder. George. Was machst du denn heute nachmittag? Das ist ja wohl meine Sache. Ich habe nur gedacht, wer wir sind interessantes gefunden haben. Was denn? Das ist unser Geheimnis. Wie sind die den H\u00fcgel am Ende vom Strand? Du kannst es dir noch mal \u00fcberlegen. Es ist wirklich eine tolle Sache, was wir da gefunden haben. So, komm! K\u00fcrzen, sind Sie da? Was ist los f\u00fcr den? Ich habe es als Wochenkerne Informationen mehr vor den bekommen. Ich verstehe sie nicht, zu k\u00fcrfen, dass sie mit denen wieder Gesch\u00e4fte machen. Ich habe es dar\u00fcber \u00fcber und was es hier geht. Hallo, Karre. Ihr Chancen. Wie sch\u00f6n mal wieder ihre Stimme zu h\u00f6ren. Ich habe das Gef\u00fchl, ihre T\u00e4tigkeit ist in den unangenehmen Stadion getroffen. Ich habe es nicht mehr. Ich habe das Gef\u00fchl, ihre T\u00e4tigkeit ist in den unangenehmen Stadion getreten. Pech f\u00fcr Sie. Auch \u00fcbrigens noch was. Sie werden Mr. K\u00fcrten auf der Frequenz nicht mehr empfangen. Komm, h\u00f6r Sie. Wir sind sich wohl dar\u00fcber klar, dass sie Unern\u00e4mlichkeiten bekommen. zuerst einmal werden wir beide uns gr\u00fcndlich unterhalten. Ich glaube, hier ist schon eblich keiner mehr gewesen. Man kann nicht mal das Ende sehen. Die muss unheimlich weit reingehen. Kommt. Das ist keine H\u00f6hle. Das ist ein Tunnel, die noch jemand gebaut hat. Der ist ja unheimlich lang. Hier geht sich erweitern bis unschneinz mehr. Was ist denn das? Das ist ein Hund. Hey, wir bist du denn? Wenn der wo geh\u00f6rt. Keine Ahnung, vielleicht die und jemanden am Strand. Timmy, Timmy, wo bist du? Das ist doch George. Ich h\u00f6r mal nicht richtig. Das ist also jetzt tolles Geheimnis. Kommt. Timmy, wie oft habe ich dir schon gesagt, dass du keine Kandidchen jagen sollst? Timmy, gef\u00e4lligst anw\u00e4hn ich die, was sage? Mach dir in ein Artiger Hund zu was? Du bist ein ganz schlimmer. Komm jetzt. Muss man dir denn alles tausend mal tangen? Hallo George. Dick, was ist also Timmy? Wo wei\u00dft du denn sein Namen? Du hast dir noch gerade gerufen. Der hat uns einen gro\u00dfen Schreck eingehrt. Der ist ja wirklich s\u00fc\u00df, George, geh\u00f6rte dir? Ja. Und warum haben wir noch nicht im Haus gesehen? Vater hat mir verboten, ihn zu behalten, aber ein jungerm Dorf versorgt ihn f\u00fcr mich. Ich w\u00fcrde lieber vorhungern, als das sich im Weg gehen w\u00fcrde. Und au\u00dferdem halt ich so nix auch nicht aus. Ach, jetzt kapiere ich, dass deshalb paust du also so viel ab. Aber du brauchst keine Angst zu haben. Wir verraten ein Geheimnis nicht. Ganz bestimmt nicht George. Versprech dir mir das? Ja, wir versprechen das. Uns gef\u00e4llt dir doch genauso gut wie dir. Ja. Freunde? Freunde. Ich fand das sowieso nicht gut, dass wir Freunde waren. Was ich dir noch sagen wollte, George. Der Tunnel, den wir gefunden haben, das ist kein normaler Tunnel. Sehr weit sind wir nicht gekommen, aber wir haben ein paar Stufen gefunden. Ja, die f\u00fchren direkt in die Erde. Und ein Richtung zum Meer raus. Kommst du mit? Na klar, kommt. Hallo, Kinder. Na was ist nur mit meiner Einladung? Gehen wir lieber bevor ihr uns fragt, dass ihr hier unten suchen. Ja, ich hab sowieso Hunger. Okay, wir kommen. Komm rein. Mach's euch bequem. Und das ist jetzt da ich hier. Entschuldig, das ist ein bisschen unaufger\u00e4umtisch. Hint, seht euch mal das Fernrohr an. Oh ja, das ist mein Hobby. Ich beobachte V\u00f6gel. Karin Island. Oh, ich kann ja ungewendens Tomgangs deutlich sehen. Eine Adderabend, B\u00fcrokorax. Selten eine K\u00fcstenv\u00f6gel, ein paar davon hab ich auf der Insel ersp\u00e4t. Ja, und euch hab ich nat\u00fcrlich auch gesehen. Na, wie geht es denn deinem Vater? Meinem Vater auch hier. Er ist fast fertig, hatte gesagt. Ah, ist da das? Ja. Der gute alte Quentin. \u00c4h, nun ja. Vielleicht k\u00f6nnte die im helfenden Tisch dicken. Ein bisschen Kuchen und Kekse sind dort drin. Ich mach inzwischen den Tee. Nicht da oben. Du findest alles in dem Unterrittfach, mein Junge. Oh, Entschuldigung. Ach, du meine G\u00fcte. Die Tante. Ich meine, meine Tante, Tante, Jun. Sie kommt zum Tee. Habt ihr das vergessen? Sie kennen sie doch sicher. Oh ja, nat\u00fcrlich, ja. Die Tame ist wirklich reizend. Ich hab ihm ein leider gleich weg. Tut mir leid. Auf Wiedersehen und vielen Dank. Ich hab aber... Es ist wirklich b\u00fcrtwein, uns entschuldigen sie bitte. Trotzdem vielen Dank. Auf Wiedersehen. Na ja, dann vielleicht ein Andermal. Wer ist denn Tante, Jun? Wir haben \u00fcberhaupt keine Tante, Jun. Nat\u00fcrlich nicht, aber trotzdem hat er gesagt, er kennt sie. Der tut nur, soll's w\u00e4re ein Freund von Vater. Aber ich hab den Karl noch niemals vorgesehen. Du h\u00e4ttest ihn nicht sagen d\u00fcrfen, dass Vater fast fertig ist. Du wei\u00dft genau, dass das geheime ist. Ich schie\u00dfe mir, Lloyd George. Ich hab mich dran gedacht. Meinst du nicht \u00fcbertreibst die Sachen ein bisschen George? Nein, ich glaub, sie hat recht. Du hast bestimmt nicht gesehen, was in dem Schrank. Da war ein Funkr\u00e4t, dann sind ich gro\u00dfes. Oh Mann! Wirklich ausgezeichnet, Kirk. Und ja, es tut mir leid, ich... Sie waren so pl\u00f6tzlich weg. Ich konnte \u00fcberhaupt keine Fragen stellen. Ich hab alles geh\u00f6rt, was ich wissen wollte. Professor Kirin ist also, wie der Junge sagte, fast fertig. Nicht zu verbissen, Kirk. Sie haben noch eine Menge Vorh\u00e4ute nach. Ja, vielleicht. Trotzdem glaube ich, dass wir uns viel zu viel Gedanken machen. Solange ungequend die noch p\u00fcnktlich signalisiert. Es ist gleich ab 11. Ohi, das fliegt sehr viel kreativ. Das fliegt ja \u00fcber die Insel. Habt ihr seinen Zeichen schon gesehen, Kinder? Nein, noch nicht. Muss jeden Moment kommen. Mach schon Vater los. Da! Eins. Zwei. Drei. Alles in Ordnung, George. Nichts passiert. Es ist alles in Ordnung, Tante Fanny. Gut. Jetzt ab ins Weg mit euch. Mach, mach. Puder bin ich aber erleichtert. Aber morgen fr\u00fch werde ich jetzt essen, den Turm mit einem Fahrenglas beobachten. Gute Nacht. Gute Nacht. Nacht. Nacht. Nacht. Ah! Professor Kirin, n\u00e4mlich an. Wer zum Teufel sind Sie? Ich glaube, kaum, dass ich mich kenn' mein Name ist Johnson. Ich bin vom Forschungsministerium. Gott sei Dank, Mr. Johnson. Im ersten Moment habe ich geglaubt, Sie lern uns, was wir sagen. Das ist nicht besser, dass ich wahr beim Forschungsministerium. Denn k\u00fcrzlich habe ich beschlossen, einen eigenes Ministerium zu machen. Verstehen Sie? Und dies ist der Anfang, Professor. Der beste, den ich mir denken kann. Hier auf Kirin Island. Was hinter Verboten in T\u00fcren aufsteckt? Wir kenne kein Zur\u00fcck. Es wird vor uns entdeckt. Wir lassen uns keine Gefalle. Wir sind auch auf uns wir packen, wir k\u00f6nnen uns wiederstehen. Und Freunde, das sind wir. Julien, dich und ich, Johnson, dir meine Hohen. Und Freunde, das sind wir. Wir kommen schneller bei. Was immer hier das Wort. Hier kommen schneller bei. Und schon sind wir da, sind wir da.",
        "translated": "If you always make an evening worthwhile, Do you have cupboards? We don't know them, because we're used to them, where there's always a puzzle to solve, up in the old castle or having a drink, and my, that's us. Talk about it, it's with me, we'll see if it's here. Break everything, Grindel- get it. Well, how far are you, Mr. Wodjas? Almost ready, Mrs. Kirin. Good. Jot. Jot. Please get ready. And maybe you'll clear your room too, if you should be here any minute. How far is it? Maybe another mile. We drove five miles from the train station. It's not too loud, so we're finally getting away. It's nice here, isn't it? Yes, yes, still great. Oh, just look at the sea. That's definitely possible over there, one. Oh yes, it should be, I want. What kind of strange thing is that? I have no idea. But Ginny definitely knows. Well, we don't want to be on time like that. Jot. Jodina. Really, Jodina. Jodina, come here. This has to be it. Come on. Excuse me. Is this the Kirin Cottage? How would you know that? We're relatives of Jodina. Her mother invited us. And Professor Kirin also caught that gang of rascals. And three more who swarm around and disturb him at work. He's damn lucky that he's on the island most of the time. Then he must have built this weird toem. Yes, something to do with his experiment. But it's top secret, of course. So be careful and don't talk to strangers about it there. And don't let yourself get caught in one of my vegetable pictures. The overbetters, what kind of older are we than rabbits. Oh, that's who you are. It's nice to see you again, though. Tachpante Fanny. You've been here a while since the last time I saw you. End was still a baby back then. Just a minute. You must be Julien and that's fat. How was the trip? Simply brilliant, Aunt Fanny. The journey from the station here was great. OK. I've called the station. Your things are being brought here. Put the drivers behind the house. Tea will be ready soon. I'm sure you're hungry too. I'm just putting them in. When legs fall off the bike. Especially at the end. What spoke so that she kept holding her head. Mine is somehow missing again. I'd say you've already said that you're for the here-buying. And now the station and waiting room for half. Wonderful afternoon. Wonderful afternoon. Yes, I must say, Mr. Johnson. I hope you ate well. But that's just a bit too much acting up. It's time for a nice cup of office tea. Oh dear. Yes. Yes. Miss Peters, I have to go away for a few days. I'm sure the Minister will manage without me until I get back. We'll let you drive the car up, please, Miss Peters. Yes, Mr. Johnson. Thank you. I thought we'd all drive to the island tomorrow and have lunch with Uncle Quentin. Great! Where's a Georgian-Tamte fan meet? We were looking forward to seeing her so much. Which isn't great. George always disappears when she shouldn't. But what do you call her George? She wants it that way. But everyone thinks she's a boy and not a girl. Apparently she doesn't want it any other way. I don't want people to think I'm a boy. No, of course not. But you're not like George either. Oh, I'm glad you showed up. We've eaten almost everything. I'm not hungry, thank you, Mother. Don't you want to say hello? This is End, Dick and Julian. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Why don't you go out with them, George? And show them around a bit. But I still have to. Yes, what? What do you have to do? Nothing. Then it's very good. So off you go. I'll clear the table. Thanks for the Tentefenn. I lived there too, it was a lot of fun, kids. Listen. Don't be back too late. No, no. Tentefenni said we were going to the island on Anglckwent. I don't have to say that classically. My name is not George. My name is George. And the island is not his, it is mine. Why are you getting so worked up? It belongs to me. He gave it to me. And now you work there and won't let me go there at all. But if his work is a big secret, why does he do it in a place where anyone can go if they want to? You can try it, the cliffs in front of the island will turn your boat into splinters. Only father and I know how to get through there. He is there because he needs the tides for his experiments. That is why he is on my island. I think that is great, too, listening to my own island. Listen. I have something to do now. It is only about me, what do you understand. So come on, don't sneak up on me. None of you. What are we doing here? What could be fun with you? Well, it's not that bad for you, but I have to share a room with her. I tell you, it'll be a long time before two of you get used to it. Yes, I'm still here for a few weeks. Can I bring him another one? Why not, if she can pay for it? Oh, that would be a pleasure. Please? Thank you. Jimmy! Jimmy! And come on, Jimmy, come on, come on, come on! Come on, my little one, oh, Jimmy! That's Quentin Kirin's little one, isn't it? Yes. She's as wild as a boy. And most people here just call her George, cheers. Cheers. That's her dog. The professed man didn't want the dog in the house. She should have given him away, but she's more attached to the dog than a common man. That's a Sibhoist, Quentin, now. I haven't seen him for a long time. Ah, he's withdrawn almost completely to the island, experimenting. Nothing comes over at all anymore. His wife brings everything he needs over to the island. First he has to signal to me that everything is OK. Then he flashes his hand three times from the tour with a handkerchief. Every morning and every evening at 11. After that they can go to their original positions. Everyone has their quirks. Isn't it crazy to work so much? Come on, come on, I like it here. If only George didn't immediately feel stupid inside, say come on, George to her. And finally upstairs you have to pay for the ice cream. You only say that because I'm such a sofa-lover. MAYORn! What does Abbesiereinlone look like to you? That looks sensual<|la|> Campbell Hirle. You can't see much there. I couldn't play juegosd quality alive! We can't go without a handkerchief either. Good, let's go back and get one. There's not enough time for that. You know what, we'll come back here tomorrow and examine it then? Sure, it's not going to run away. Just wait. But we'll keep it to ourselves, OK? George has secrets here and this hill is only our secret. Okay? Okay. Oh, hello children. You're visiting Karen Cutt now, aren't you? Yes, that's right. Didn't George come with you? No. Oh yes, uncle and your aunt are good friends of mine. Don't you want to have tea with me tomorrow? Well, I don't know what we're doing yet. Well, it doesn't matter, it sounds funny to her. I want to be happy. See you again. Strange Couts. That for me, only about strange people here. Habte Fendi is the only normal person I've met here so far. Uncle Quentin seems to be a bit strange too. Yes, we'll find that out tomorrow when we go over to the island, right. Can I go over then, George? No, the cliffs are nice, but we'll definitely go away. It's not like we don't get on so well. Yes, we'll find that out tomorrow when we go over to the island, right. Yes, can I go over then, George? No, the cliffs feel like it, but definitely not. That's how you can go to them. That's how it is. There it looks like a child. How are you? Father! That's with a cupboard tone that's hanging? No. In the call comes, that's where it comes from. That's the way you can go to it. That's the way you can go to it. Father! Father! That's with a cupboard tone that's hanging? No, in the call comes, the most to drive. George takes the boys and see if you can find him. Okay, come on! I still wanted to eat her. Father! Father! No, I've never seen that before? Look at that! Tell me, George, do you know what those things are up there by the gate? I could imagine that it has something to do with solar energy. The reflectors or again, that is, maybe beannahs. Father! Father! You're not feeling up there. You've got to be somewhere. Here I am. You're not feeling up there. You've got to be somewhere. Here I am! Prof. K\u00f6rin, your island seems to be attracting quite a bit of attention. You've grown since the last time. That was eight years ago. Oh really? Then it was to be expected, wasn't it? What do you think? Where are you hanging out on the island at the moment? In the cellars. In the cellars? Under the ruins, the cellars of the old castle. Tell me, is that your secret hole? Yes, you can call it that if you like. Can we have a proper time with George too? She rowed us out, around the dangerous cliffs. Wow, she can row. It's all in a young age, you know? Well, now I have to go back. I've got something to check too. Thanks for the supplies. George, you can have your island back soon. I'm as good as finished. And who doesn't go the signals? I usually do it too. No, I'm thinking about it. Do we still have it with you now? Well then. Bye. Bye. You there, you there. A lovely surprise, you could see it. Johnson. I suppose you observe rare waterfowl, don't you? What a splendid telescope. Yes, it is a splendid telescope. Oh, so tell me, who are you working for this time? Russia, China, America? Last time we met you were very unpleasant to us. I hope you realize that. Look, I don't work for anybody. I give you my word. Your word. Oh, if that isn't a radio, I want to drop dead. Now, that's enough. Put your life preservers in. Now, and you wear this. Now, sick children. George. What are you doing this afternoon? That's my business. I was just thinking who we are and whether we've found anything interesting. What? That's our secret. How did they get to the hill at the end of the beach? You can think about it again. It really is a marvelous thing we've found there. Now, come on! Shorten, are you there? What's the matter with him? I have received it as a weekly core of information before the. I don't understand them, to choose that they do business with them again. I have it about and what this is about. Hello, Karre. Your chances. How nice to hear your voice again. I have the feeling that your activity has entered the unpleasant stadium. I don't have it anymore. I have the feeling that your activity has entered the unpleasant stadium. Bad luck for you. And by the way, something else. You will no longer receive Mr. K\u00fcrten on the frequency. Come, listen to you. We are well aware that you will have unpleasantness. First of all, we will both have a thorough talk. I don't think anyone has been here for a long time. You can't even see the end. It must go in incredibly far. Come. This is not a cave. This is a tunnel that someone else has built. It is incredibly long. It widens out here until it is no longer there. What is that? It's a dog. Hey, who are you? If it belongs somewhere. I don't know, maybe them and someone on the beach. Timmy, Timmy, where are you? That's George. I'm not hearing right. So that's a great secret. Come on. Timmy, how many times have I Have you ever been told not to chase candy? Timmy, please let me call them, what do you say? Be a good dog, eh? You're a bad one. Come on now. Do you have to be told everything a thousand times? Hello, George. Dick, what's Timmy? How do you know his name? You were just calling him. He gave us quite a fright. He's really cute, George, was it yours? Yes. And why haven't we seen him in the house yet? Father has forbidden me to keep him, but a young man is looking after him for me. I'd rather starve than get in the way. And besides, I can't stand anything like that. Oh, now I see that's why you're copying so much. But you needn't be afraid. We won't tell you a secret. Certainly not George. Promise me that? Yes, we promise that. We like you as much as you do. Yes. Friends? Friends. I didn't like the fact that we were friends anyway. What I wanted to tell you, George. The tunnel we found isn't a normal tunnel. We didn't get very far, but we found a few steps. Yes, they lead straight into the ground. And one way out to the sea. Are you coming with me? Of course, come. Hello, children. Well, what about my invitation? We'd better go before you ask us to look down here. Yes, I'm hungry anyway. OK, we're coming. Come in. Make yourselves comfortable. And this is me here now. Sorry, it's a bit messy. Hint, take a look at the telescope. Oh yes, that's my hobby. I watch birds. Karin Island. Oh, I can see tomgangs clearly. An adderabend, burrowing corax. Rare coastal birds, I spotted a few of them on the island. Yes, and of course I saw you too. Well, how is your father? My father is here too. He's almost finished, he said. Ah, is that there? Yes. Good old Quentin. Er, well. Perhaps she could help me in the table. There's some cake and biscuits in there. I'll make the tea in the meantime. Not up there. You'll find everything in the under-ride drawer, my boy. Oh, sorry. Oh, my goodness. The aunt. I mean, my aunt, Aunt Jun. She's coming for tea. Have you forgotten? You know her, I'm sure. Oh yes, of course, yes. The aunt is really lovely. I've sent him a message straight away. I'm sorry. Goodbye and thank you very much. But I have... It's really bad, please excuse us. Thank you very much anyway. Goodbye. Well, maybe another time then. Who's Aunt Jun? We haven't got an aunt at all, Jun. Of course not, but he said he knows her anyway. He's just pretending he's a friend of father's. But I've never planned on Karl. You shouldn't have told him Father was almost finished. You know it's secret. I'm shooting myself, Lloyd George. I thought of that. Don't you think you're exaggerating things a bit, George? No, I think she's right. You certainly didn't see what was in the cupboard. There was a radio, then I'm big. Oh man! Really excellent, Kirk. And yes, I'm sorry, I... They left so suddenly. I couldn't ask any questions. I heard everything I wanted to know. So Professor Kirin is, as the boy said, almost finished. Don't be too stubborn, Kirk. They still have a lot of foreskins left. Yes, maybe. Still, I think we're worrying too much. As long as Unquend still signals on time. It's almost 11. Oh, that's flying very creatively. That's flying over the island. Have you seen his signal yet, children? No, not yet. Should be coming any minute. Get going, Father. There! One. Two. Three. Everything's OK, George. Nothing's wrong. Everything's OK, Aunt Fanny. Good. Now off you go. Go, go. I'm powdery though relieved. But tomorrow morning I'll eat, watching the tower through a telescope. Good night. Good night. Night. Night. Night. Ah! Professor Kirin, that is. Who the devil are you? I don't think I know myself, my name is Johnson. I'm from the Ministry of Research. Thank God, Mr. Johnson. At first I thought you would learn what we say. It's no better that I'm at the Ministry of Research. Because recently I decided to set up my own ministry. Do you understand? And this is the beginning, Professor. The best I can think of. Here on Kirin Island. What's behind the bans in doors? We know no turning back. It will be discovered before us. We don't accept any favors. We are on our own, we pack, we can resist. And friends, that's who we are. Julien, you and I, Johnson, my dears. And friends, that's who we are. We'll get there quicker. Whatever the word here. We'll get there quicker. And here we are, here we are."

And when I asked who she was, she told me by her, No one we could ever be like by her, by your wife question me. Why is no one so far away? My, my, she's always in a pretty pickle my eye, Helping someone else's little my eye, My, everyone was my eye, my eye, my eye, My, our containers what you see. That's the thing for me. I can't catch my eye, I can't catch this yet. Hey, all careful, please, what are you doing? Hang on a sec. Hang on a sec. There's Alexander. Wow, how are you, Alexander? So, so, I guess. Oh, I see you have another piece of cheese. Yes, then you can smell how good it is. Well, I must be going. Goodness, what a painful business. Thank you, everything has seen such an effort. I hope he's not sick, he's not getting any younger. Oh, Mr. Turtle, how are you? Oh, it's you, Maya. Hello, I'm fine, thanks. Hello, Maya, isn't it a beautiful day? Yes, Flip, it's lovely. Well, I'm coming, I'm coming. Here you are. How is close? I'm glad I could help you. Without your help, I would surely have drowned. I was very big, Jonathan. I think so, I've always managed them before. I wonder if I'm getting old. It could be arthritis. Oh, these old bones, they don't work well anymore. Hello, Frida. I've been looking for you everywhere. And last night, I was wondering what you mean, Maya. What's that, I see? Buck and Maya. Hey, hey, hey. Yes? What's this all about? Huh? Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Oh, forgive me, my darling, I was getting worse and worse. I mixed you up with Maya. I know that you're a short sighted, but don't do something hideous to me. No, really. Oh, Frida, please, there's no reason to start crying. You know, I'm very nearly lost my life today through my short sightedness. I only just managed to escape. The fly-sorto missed me by a hare's breath. Oh, that's been my nightmare for years. Just think when he's usually so far. Oh! Oh! I've got the feeling my hearing is getting worse. I can't hear the high notes at all anymore. Terrible, that's... You've been in a huge loss, you're out of tune. He's just what could be worse than a violent vertuous who suddenly loses my hearing. One of them can't jump, and the others are losing their sight and hearing. Just wait and hear it. No, no, no. Just wait and hear it. No, no, no, no, no. First you must tell me what you want. Oh! I'll tell you something, my darling, you must stop chasing me like this. My heart won't take it. Strange, I'm also completely out of breath. Oh dear, I hope it's not old age creeping up on us, Kurt. I fear it may be, for weeks now when I work, I feel a stabbing here in my shoulder. Oh dear! Soge my shoulder for me a bit. Yes, of course. It's a nut I'll make a good herb too for the two. Ah, that was nice. Come on, dude, for you too. Hmm, you do that well. Ah, seems as if everybody's sick. Oh no, ring comes away. I can't believe it. I won't believe it. I want to imagine this butterfly had hurt yourself. I'm so sorry. Oh dear. Oh dear. I must ask her again, perhaps she's really sick. Please tell me, don't you feel very well? What? Oh! I'm just putting on my beauty, Marzka. Sorry, I hope I didn't frighten you. You're doing what? My heart is covered with wrinkles on my face. This is a mixture of honey and sunflower seed oil. That'll get rid of wrinkles? Of course it will. It's a famous old remedy. Explain to me, do wrinkles hurt you? What a silly question. When you've given your life to beauties I have, they can hurt you most terribly. How would you like to try them? Oh, I didn't know. Oh yes, I had the same confidence as you have just a couple of years ago. But you lose that as soon as you lose your beauty, believe me. It's very nice to only. Suddenly all my friends are worried at the beginning to get old. But I can see it. They can't do the things they used to be able to do. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh. Oh. Oh. Hey, you. Hey, you. Hey, you. Hey, you. Hello, Maya. Maya, Maya. Wake up. What's the matter? We're going to go and visit Alexander today. But who are you? Are you so old that you can't even tell who your best friends are anymore? I'm Philip, of course. And today we're going to go and see Alexander. And we're going to have a talk about the good old. Oh, yes, that's right. Hey, you. Hey. Not so fast, but I can't fly as well as I could. What do you mean for someone your age is still like? Extremely well here. It's easy if we help each other. Hey, you. Oh, here it is. Oh, what do you want? Oh, it's flipped if I'm not mistaken. Wait, right, right, right. What's that? Who did you buy? I said, quite right. Yeah. And who is this we've got here? Madam Butterfly, how nice of you to meet. Yeah. Who do you like another cup of tea? Nothing. I can't understand how in my young days I didn't like to eat cheese at all. Just so as I choose it, the young people are. If you please don't feel obliged. You're nice and soft. Just nice, my poor old tea. By the way, Mr. Beckler, wouldn't you like to play a little something for us as well? Respectler. And you're poor and exandy. You can't see very well over here, very well anymore. Only eat cheese. It's my over there, myer. Of course, now I remember myer can't play anymore because she's got room. It's just explaining to him. We all of us know that we're getting old, but he's totally gaga. Well, I said, you want some gorgonzola? Why don't have any in this misgloss until the autumn festival. I'm not going to school eating it all right, good. It's such a pity about poor old Alexander. We're still a couple of spring chickens compared to him. When's it for the time? That's how all fairytales start. Way to the days when we were still young, myer. Now be careful not to strain yourself. You're old enough. Oh, as long as I can still fly, Flip. Life is not so bad. Oh, oh, oh, I can't stay up. I'm dropping low and low. Oh! Why don't you watch out, you're blocking the road. You could at least apologize to why you anyway. I don't recognize him. What's that? You don't know us anymore. You're a very nice lady. It's true, but sure you should recognize us. You're the three lady bird children. Can you really not remember us, myer? Yes, I do. Well, sort of. Think back. Well, of course, now I remember you must be the three lady bird children. But goodness, you're so big. Well, we're old enough, aren't we? When you've grown old, that's your difference. Now you listen to me. Even if you have grown up, you've still got absolutely no right to call me an old being. Do you understand? Oh, that's hard, I remember. She was always fighting. Really? That's got very old. You're gonna put her down now. Have a look at the water. Can you see with an old bag of bones you've turned into? Oh! Oh! What's going on? How can you be so small? You were a giant. At least twice as tall as I am. Let's see if we can make her up. Ah! Whether you're bigger or smaller, you're always causing trouble. Oh, I dreamed that. Good, I was right. It was just a nasty dream. I'm not an old being. And I can still fly perfectly. My wings are as good as ever. Oh, my old woman, I like the dogs. Yes. Oh! Ah! I'm so glad that was a dream. I can fly as well as ever and that's never going to change. And that I know for absolutely certain. At least I don't notice my getting old. Oh! Oh, Doctor Snail. I see you're in good mood as you. Oh, yes. But please excuse me for sitting on your house. That's alright. I was just having a good think about something that's been bothering me a lot. So I went into my shell. I'm worried about the health of our insects. Doctor Snail, Doctor Snail. We're calling Doctor Snail. Yes, Snail, Doctor Snail. And it's much of the greatest suffer the great miss for you. Oh, please Doctor Snail, won't you go and see him? Careful, Doctor Snail. He's rolling down. Oh, I have a good dream. Why do I always have a dream? There's no time for foolishness. Alexander, what's the matter? It happened when I wanted to pick up my cheese. And all of a sudden I experienced a terrible pain in my hip. Possibly a hernia. I lift him up carefully and put him down over there. Hopefully we won't have to operate on you if we're lucky that is. You believe it. He picks up a piece of cheese and gives himself a hernia. I'll have to do a thorough examination. Do you remember what I was saying, Maya? For some time now I've been scratching my head about the health of a lot of insects around here. Why not examine everyone? I'll go and call them. Very good. We will take it upon ourselves to instruct everybody to come here. Today's examinations have borne out what I suspected, which is that the physical condition of most of you leads a lot to be desired. If you don't do something about it, you'll all end up as old crocs. You see, that's where the pain in your shoulder comes from. That's where! Could I be old already? It's terrible, everyone. Oh! As from today and three times a day, you will all do physical exercises to slow down the process of growing old. As you know, physical exercises are the best way to do that. That's a good idea. I'll begin with some stomach exercises so that I can eat much more pollen. You'll definitely come to a bad end. If you carry on like that one day, you fall out of the air because your wings won't be a supporter. I hope that'll make you think, will you? To tell the truth, it won't. It'll still be a long time before I'm too heavy to fly. That's no reason for not doing a bit of training. I won't have to train, will I? Oh, yes, you will. It's never too early to start my dear Maya. I think you're right. When I think of what happened, perhaps I've become too fat and slow to get out of the way any time. We'll start right away with the exercises, an easy one to begin with. First, we run as fast as we can, and then, every four or five steps, we jump into the air like rabbits. Any question? That sounds too terrible. Do you think we are managed? I'm practicing my web. Run and jump, must we? No, don't do that. It's difficult. All right, then, forget it. And in a few months, you'll all be crippled and lame. Help! Help! A fire fire! Somebody's house is the fire! It's the fire! Look, you can see the smoke. I'll tell you where the fire is. Ah! Alexander, it's your own house that's going up in flames. What? You're saying my house will fire! My house will fire! Don't do the counter. In your training today, we was going to put Alexander's fire out. That is good training. I don't know if I'll be able to help with my body, how to condition like this. The south of your silly jokes, will he? There's no time for that. Everybody don't, the stream and fill buckets. Make a lot of change to Alexander's house, the house will pass along. Alexander, Alexander, it's your own house. It's your own house. Take it, take it, fire out. It's your own house. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, it's big! It's big! It's big! Such cases I'm very useful. My valuable stuff! Oh! This is a good opportunity to give a demonstration of my aromatic flying. I went up to the fire into the flames. Don't stop now, everyone! The fire's nearly out! Where'll you be? Next Right-again and this Right-Pause-Avishment- nave! Oh, and if they'd be married too late to fire's out. Yes, sir! Fire's out! Oh, my friends, how on earth am I going to that? Thank you for I so fightin' it's been any further. Anyone on his own would have been helpless against that inferno. It should all stick together. I'm always here, always on duty. Anyone can ask me for help any time. If such a pity that they hit what the boof my fire had you dump sharing off like that. And hug your hip-toings I may ask. Good heavens, it was hurting me so terribly and now I don't feel a single thing. No way, I'm healthy! I do fine again. I'm in duck form! So anyway, hurrah! I don't think we need your physical exercises anymore Doctor. I think the fire proved was wearing good condition and still feeling young. That's how I feel. Yes, I don't think we have any need of those exercises. We don't have to hop around like rabbits. There you have it Doctor Snail. Everyone's feeling well and in top condition. That's where you're wrong. We find the special strength only in emergencies. No, you must train. Now we're all going to run over to that corner there and back. So please everyone take your places. We'll start at once. But first a small and tasty token of my appreciation. Oh! Oh! No, no thanks. Thanks for the same good night! Sit your running run as far as the big holly tree then at least it'll do you good. Ah! I'm sure you'll agree Doctor there's nothing better than cheese to keep the body healthy. Ah! Have a slice dear friends. This is one of the most delicious varieties. Mmm! Ah! Mmm! Good bye to you. I understand why nobody likes my cheese Doctor Snail. Oh! Doctor! Bye him! Oh, I never thought cheese would make me run. That cheese in the middle of the meadow every day we'd see everybody run. Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!",

Oh, please Doctor Snail, won't you go and see him? Careful, Doctor Snail. He's rolling down. Oh, I have a good dream. Why do I always have a dream? There's no time for foolishness. Alexander, what's the matter? It happened when I wanted to pick up my cheese. And all of a sudden I experienced a terrible pain in my hip. Possibly a hernia. I lift him up carefully and put him down over there. Hopefully we won't have to operate on you if we're lucky that is. You believe it. He picks up a piece of cheese and gives himself a hernia. I'll have to do a thorough examination. Do you remember what I was saying, Maya? For some time now I've been scratching my head about the health of a lot of insects around here. Why not examine everyone? I'll go and call them. Very good. We will take it upon ourselves to instruct everybody to come here. Today's examinations have borne out what I suspected, which is that the physical condition of most of you leads a lot to be desired. If you don't do something about it, you'll all end up as old crocs. You see, that's where the pain in your shoulder comes from. That's where! Could I be old already? It's terrible, everyone. Oh! As from today and three times a day, you will all do physical exercises to slow down the process of growing old. As you know, physical exercises are the best way to do that. That's a good idea. I'll begin with some stomach exercises so that I can eat much more pollen. You'll definitely come to a bad end. If you carry on like that one day, you fall out of the air because your wings won't be a supporter. I hope that'll make you think, will you? To tell the truth, it won't. It'll still be a long time before I'm too heavy to fly. That's no reason for not doing a bit of training. I won't have to train, will I? Oh, yes, you will. It's never too early to start my dear Maya. I think you're right. When I think of what happened, perhaps I've become too fat and slow to get out of the way any time. We'll start right away with the exercises, an easy one to begin with. First, we run as fast as we can, and then, every four or five steps, we jump into the air like rabbits. Any question? That sounds too terrible. Do you think we are managed? I'm practicing my web. Run and jump, must we? No, don't do that. It's difficult. All right, then, forget it. And in a few months, you'll all be crippled and lame. Help! Help! A fire fire! Somebody's house is the fire! It's the fire! Look, you can see the smoke. I'll tell you where the fire is. Ah! Alexander, it's your own house that's going up in flames. What? You're saying my house will fire! My house will fire! Don't do the counter. In your training today, we was going to put Alexander's fire out. That is good training. I don't know if I'll be able to help with my body, how to condition like this. The south of your silly jokes, will he? There's no time for that. Everybody don't, the stream and fill buckets. Make a lot of change to Alexander's house, the house will pass along. Alexander, Alexander, it's your own house. It's your own house. Take it, take it, fire out. It's your own house. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, it's big! It's big! It's big! Such cases I'm very useful. My valuable stuff! Oh! This is a good opportunity to give a demonstration of my aromatic flying. I went up to the fire into the flames. Don't stop now, everyone! The fire's nearly out! Where'll you be? Next Right-again and this Right-Pause-Avishment- nave! Oh, and if they'd be married too late to fire's out. Yes, sir! Fire's out! Oh, my friends, how on earth am I going to that? Thank you for I so fightin' it's been any further. Anyone on his own would have been helpless against that inferno. It should all stick together. I'm always here, always on duty. Anyone can ask me for help any time. If such a pity that they hit what the boof my fire had you dump sharing off like that. And hug your hip-toings I may ask. Good heavens, it was hurting me so terribly and now I don't feel a single thing. No way, I'm healthy! I do fine again. I'm in duck form! So anyway, hurrah! I don't think we need your physical exercises anymore Doctor. I think the fire proved was wearing good condition and still feeling young. That's how I feel. Yes, I don't think we have any need of those exercises. We don't have to hop around like rabbits. There you have it Doctor Snail. Everyone's feeling well and in top condition. That's where you're wrong. We find the special strength only in emergencies. No, you must train. Now we're all going to run over to that corner there and back. So please everyone take your places. We'll start at once. But first a small and tasty token of my appreciation. Oh! Oh! No, no thanks. Thanks for the same good night! Sit your running run as far as the big holly tree then at least it'll do you good. Ah! I'm sure you'll agree Doctor there's nothing better than cheese to keep the body healthy. Ah! Have a slice dear friends. This is one of the most delicious varieties. Mmm! Ah! Mmm! Good bye to you. I understand why nobody likes my cheese Doctor Snail. Oh! Doctor! Bye him! Oh, I never thought cheese would make me run. That cheese in the middle of the meadow every day we'd see everybody run. Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!"

She said she'd never turn on me, you're alive and lame. What you did, what you did, you're alive and lame. All this fame you said I'd never feel like I'm lame. But I do, but I do do do do. Yeah, I go. Oh, little part of time. Don't worry about time. I'll turn it up. Oh, my dog. I'm never. Oh, my dog. Oh, my dog. I'm never. Oh, my dog. Stop with my bad, your big brother. I'm never. Oh, my dog. What's in here? What? What? What? What? What? What? You're a shotgun blast to make a hold at large. What you got done in here? Your dealings is fugitives named Billy Lucas. Murder weapons, bags, and tag, and you should have. I'll put it in there next to my cruise. All I got to name, Herica Rockler. She called it in and waited. But she did pull the trigger. But she said I'll put it in on the air. I guess we've been for price. Thanks, Dunne. Slim, though. We got this. Thanks, fellas. So, uh, this rockline detective Williams is my partner in Detective Torres. You want to tell us what happened? I'll do Q&A at your precinct with my attorney present. I think said this if you continue to be violating my rights. I'm educated consumer, huh? I watch a lot of TV. All right. I'm between killing people. Is that a question to Williams? Not even close. Hey, Natasha. We hear him. We're going to the corner. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You did? That's the minute truck. I'm sure you can come down. Pick it up any time you need. No, that would be no trouble, though. I'll see you then. Oh, bye. Woo! Yo, Ed. She left her glasses. And this truck, I, she's going to come to pick them up. Well, she left was a big fat hen. Come on, man. What are you slipping now or something? You don't want it? Get it? Part B. Lieutenant, we got our perk. Her name is Eric, a rockweiss. She admitted to it and we got the weapon. And? It's an easy-close door. I don't know, gentlemen. What about motive? Oh, come on. We don't need that. We can statement her signature and ladies have done. Dean. Oh, just like that. Meanwhile, I heard that the Ben-Fuara went out on Billy Lucas two weeks ago, federal case, mixed bag of charges, counter-fitting through attempted murder. What's her role in this? Where does she fit in? What's her background? Well, she's not talking until the lawyer so is on. But all we got on her right now is that she's from North Carolina. She got three prior for being neat and again, charged. And does she do any time? No, they would drop. All right, well, you see where we might have some blanks to fill in here, gentlemen? So why don't we do that? And then we can wrap it up, all right? Yeah. All right, well, well, well. What do we got here? A mile to Jordan. He dropped us New York Attorney. She's ready to cooperate fully. Okay, I'll buy first. New York Attorney. What do you got one in every state now? Not yet. But if business picks up, I'll need more. What is this business that you do? Fugitive Retrait Ball. That almost sounds professional, huh? Well, let's be real. You're nothing but a damn bounty, honey. When the bill jumped a turn nasty, I had to take him down. It was him or me. Do I have stupid retina on my face? You expect me to buy that? No, you just don't like it. Well, that too. You see, you bounty hunters are not professionals. You don't even know what the hell you're doing up here. You're out of line, detective. My client came into town yesterday. She had certified copies of a bail agreement. She came in and she checked in with a desk sergeant downstairs. She went by the book. There is no book. That is the problem. So what really happened, Erica? He spooked you and then what? Boom, you have to shoot him. Is that what happened? I don't spook easily. And I don't get paid on corpses. Look, he took my gun. He had me on the ground. He was going to fire. I had no choice. Right, right. So how were you able to track him down so fast? Criminals are creatures of habit. Lucas had a thing for a hookah. So I just passed some cash around and waited for a never. So who ratted him out? I washed out Skink on time, square. She must have sold me out because a clown who I was coming. What's her name? Crystal. Crystal what? Shem Belair, how the hell am I supposed to know? She's a hookah. For a price you'll be any name you wanted to be. Enough of that. You make a decision. If you charge my client, we'll cut a loose. Yeah, well, that's it, gentlemen. Check the desk sergeancy if your story holds up. Lieutenant. Not what, Williams. Whether you like it or not, bounty hunting's illegal occupation. They are dangerous amateurs, Lieutenant. What about the people's rights? You just don't have any rights. They hand them over to the Bill Bond'sman who in turn gets it to the bounty hunter. Look, a man is dead. Now, he may have been a criminal, but she's the one that took his life. Yes, which only goes to support the argument that things went bad towards the end, Torres. Now, she had a lot to gain by bringing Lucas in alive. The hell of a way to make a living. What do we do now? Well, we make sure that CSU and the coroner agree on track. The coroner agree on trajectory load and buckshut spray. We cross every T dot every I. Sorry, I'm late. Don't sweat it, you covered. Cooper asked for me. She did indeed. What's your teller? You mail problems? What? It covers the myriad of elves. This way nobody asks me Jack. So where were you when you went? My attorneys. Anything wrong? I was catching. Your turn, I got the last one. Morena, fourth squad. Yep. Okay, you'll be right there. I got a shooting, Tommy. It's a car. It's nice surface. All right. Any of you not here as part of the investigation leave now. You're destroying the claim scene. How about I take the body? Offside on it you? Yeah. You need a few minutes or can you do this? No, no, look, the quick of the better. Now, how soon before the wagon gets here? I don't want to since wife seen it like this. It should be a soon. So what happened? We worked a late tour. We dropped them off as usual. I go home to crash. Camille, that's his wife. She calls me from her job. She's hysterical, and a panic. What about... She says they're talking on the phone and... Something he yells at somebody and then the phone went dead. She kept calling back but there was no answer. That's when you came over to check it out? Yeah, right. And I get here and... Take your time. The door was open and the mess and everything. It's a great time. Single shot to the head, close range. There was powder burns around the wound. I checked his pulse. I used my cell to call it in. It's been touched. Was there anything missing? It's gone. I don't know what else. We're going to have to ask Camille. I'm not. Yeah, what you got? Take a little... Okay, while there are any pictures, all angles right here. Hey! Hello? The motor live. And hello to you too. Have a seat. Are you looking good, girl? Is this what you need? Yeah. I'm always leaving those some. Hey, I'm a man. I hate to say this. Looks like old girl was right. Yeah. Ah, Natasha. This is my point of Eddie Torres. Oh, this is my French teacher. Oh, man. Right. You know what? I got a fun fight. Nice to meet you. My man. Joe, anyway, home. I just make a break. I'm outta here, Williams. What'd you do? Me? Nothing. Don't let him break you, honey. He's not gonna straighten no time. Didn't they tell you that you can go? So why don't you go? I'm after Lucas's pal, Kevin Swain. What did you do to know? Just in case. Who is that? Some... A trouble. Well, I'm gonna let you get back to work. All right, listen. What we should do, I don't know. What I think we should do, I mean, you should meet tonight. You'll have dinner with Snife Blame. Hello, Alex. Can you come? I'm gonna see they lock you up, Rock. Even if I have to do it myself. Nobody's calling me that long time. You murdered Billy Lucas. Oh, man. Listen, I'm warning you. Stay away from Kevin Swain. He's mine. Unless he's in shackles, he's up for a rant. No, not this time. We go way back, you, man. I don't wanna see you get hurt. I touched. Really? I'm gonna see you. I'm gonna see you. I'm gonna see you. I touched. Really? You think the fight is not too difficult? It was to detect his working on the case. Alex Pratt, Deputy US Marshal. How's it going? So what's this all about? Ericka Rockler. Lieutenant was telling me that so far this looks clean? What are you saying that it's not? I know it's not. Rock used to be one of us. She worked for the government. She was a Marshal. She was a good one too. Till she lost a witness in a treasury case. The two men suspected of orchestrating that particular horror show. Who Billy Lucas. And Kevin Swain. So you think that it's revenge? Absolutely. She lost her witness and her career. Not revenge. I'd say that's mild. Yes, sir. Alrighty, down. The feds say they're gonna send over that file on Kevin Swain as soon as possible. Which means never you got it. So BCI says the man's got 14 priors for four drinks. Buying a set of $2 million and like Lucas, a warrant with issue two weeks ago. Ericka bags him that's 200 G's in her pocket. That's a big payday. She's got a score to settle with this Lucas guy. Yeah, but we don't have any evidence to support America. Moadeth Ed. She lied to us. Five hundred. When we stopped with her snatch, Erica says that she sent her up, so maybe she want to ask why. Alright, we got a girl by the name of Crystal Wade, 110th and Pleasant. Where have you been? I know. You're hurting me. Where's Lucas? We have a meet in two hours. Yeah, Ed. What? What's that? Some bitch came sniffing around looking for both of you. So I called Lucas and told them about it. Shut up. No, I didn't. I swear I didn't. He told me to pay her and get her to come to the club. I just did what he said. I swear I didn't. I didn't. I wish she... Name's Erica. The cops locked her up. Where are you going? Shut up. What does that mean? I'm going with you. No, not. Yes, I am. Don't make this hardest wave. You won't survive. Ah! Shoot. You killed her. Whatever. But you, I need life. Hey, hold it, you! Back up! Club it! Put it down. He's mine. Mrs. Vincent. I'm sorry about your loss. Camille used to detect it so it'd be work in the case. I'm going to find a bastard. No, you're on the phone when this happened. Is that right? He always called me when he worked nights. I know he was all right. And what did you hear? A crash. Like something broke. Then Todd yelled and the phone went dead. Do you remember what he yelled? Okay. That's it? Would your husband suffer from depression? What difference does that make? We're just covering all the bases, Tony. You should know that. Man, was he having problems on the job? No. This is my husband. It's not unhappy. And he was not crazy. Does someone killed him or don't you care? Nice technique, Dennis. It's a hell of a way to treat one of you. You're off for the books, kid. How's that? Ben's worn a body for two mil. Uncle Sam must want you bad. I want to make a call. I'm entitled to a call. That's my right. Sure, no problem. I mean, as soon as we processed these other charges, murder, fake money, I mean, that pretty much guarantees you life. What do you want? Where'd you get the money? What do I get? I'm going to see the court, Anna. It's my own life, I guess. Sweeten the deal, I'll lead you right to him. Meet him on our riverside on the past. Me with whom? Deal first. No, you're in no position to bargain, baby. Well, maybe you should look at these senotes again, baby. They're supposed to be counterfeit proof. Tell you what. Why don't you call the feds. But they make a deal. We'll say. So tell you anything we can swing this? I'm going to talk to the state's attorney and see what we have to offer. Don't do this, Lieutenant. It's a mistake. You can't play federal games with local talent. Your opinion doesn't count. And I'm doing you a favor by even allowing you in here, Ms. Rocklar. Lieutenant, please. Let me take him in, just to consort out the rest. Now, what you really want? You pal' Pratt and the feds tell a difference. I knew Alex Pratt would fill you in. He used you. Oh, really? How? Third one of the way. See, Mama would've his strictly money. He is his prestige. He brings Tween in first. Hell, even Jenna Reena would have to take notice. Let me take him in. I have to surrender him to the sheriff to collect my fee. Sorry, this is going to go down our way. Set her up, Williams. Listen, Eric. I'm so okay, Lanc. I already know how to bend over.rey DON Liu. Pardon me? Can you hear me? What's going on, bates? I heard your legal battle, has escalated! The legal battle has escalated. Yeah, that's why I'm here. My buyer's real interested in your flights. Of course. Come on, you're not going to try to jack the price up on me, guys. Kevin, the free market is not for neophytes. When you're in trouble, you need to steal. I don't. When this bait says something concrete, he's going to want. Yeah, but you know he's going to be careful. You've got to get out of town. I'll let you know. Company. Damn, he made us. Let's go. Terrick, I found she doing it. What the hell are you doing? Get my money. Let's go. Move it now, King. Do not shoot. Purpose, fun or... Go. Go. Go. Go on. You guys, back off, gentlemen. That's the federal highway. It's waiting, man. He is protecting Wittings. Look at him. Right here. What the hell are you doing? My job. I just signed out. It's going on. There you are. Two years work down the drain because your detectives couldn't master surveillance 101. Watch how you talk about my men, Pratt, alright? And you're in no position to throw stones because you didn't even tell me that there was a federal operation going on in my jurisdiction. It wasn't my call. I protect the witness. That's it. Yeah, son of a bitch, Alex. Kenneth Swain murdered a witness under our protection and you gave that low-life snitch a deal. You have no evidence to prove that and frankly, Rock, if you remember, there is nothing more important than the national interest. You already lost your star over this, let it go. I need some air. Oh, yeah. Look, I don't like this anymore than you do, but the fact is we need bait to get Russell Gates at money. At money, it's the straights we won't recover for years. Yeah, right. So you're saying this promotion that you get for bringing a man is just gravy, right? We're bearing the soapbox detective. You're willing to make a deal with Swain to get a bait yourself. I was ready to send him to jail. Not to some beach with a new idea and a pocket full of money. Most criminals went to the program due time first. He's not going to do a day in time if it's up to you. I mean besides, we've got solid proof against your boyfriend murder. A man can't stand trial if he no longer exists. Lou, come on. Please let it go, Torres. We should have processed him while we had him. Possessions 9-10 for the war. Hey, Matt. The um, the parent intense on officer Vincent came back and conclusive. CSUs that there were too many astringent chemicals present. Like what? The beach would do it. From dust your strength cleaners. It's just suspicious enough that he's an adult washed. No, well, not if he just came out of the shower. It was washed in dishes. Thanks. Thank you. Let's go out of here. Is Detective Williams here? He'll be down in a sec. Pocket. So, what'd you do this time? I gave it to him. I knew the system wasn't perfect, but I thought it worked. You're a cop? Not anymore. I don't want to end up a drunk or a plane with muddun in the dark. Sorry. Don't waste that on me. Save that for the poor slugs like Williams. They need you, pity. I haven't known JC very long, but he does not seem like the kind of man anyone should feel sorry for. Not yet, but it's coming. He's got that cop disease. Oh, my God, I know what you're talking about. Did JC once tell me something? I prefer he told me on his own. Hmm. Then you're in for a long wait. I see cops don't talk to anybody else but cops. Wise and girlfriends. They don't know Jack until they come home and there's brains about it all over the wall. You're exaggerating. What do you say? Look, the job comes first. He can't sell dates, unanswered questions, mood swings. And if you have kids with cops, you can count on raising them young damn self. Mm-hmm. If there's one thing I know about JC, is that he takes a big part in raising his son. We'll have you ever talk to the boys and mother. I'm sure she might sing a different tone. You obviously don't know him. I know him better than you do and I'm just a madam. Give JC a message for me. Tell him not to let it get to me. If he wants you to know, it'll tell you. Oh, no. All right. Something wrong? Hey, yeah. I'm sorry. I meant to call you. That's okay. Don't worry about it. What happened? Just this case I'm working on. You know, the whole thing went bust. It's even a bad taste to my mouth. Well, I'm a good listener if you want somebody to talk to. Oh, thanks. Okay. Well, I'll tell you later. I'll do. Oh, yeah. That girl that was here earlier. Where are you? Yeah. She told me to tell you don't let it get to you. She said that, huh? Yeah, she's one to talk. Did she say where she was going? Sorry. We're going. See you later. Listen. This one shouldn't know I really did want to see you tonight. Yeah, me too. All right. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going.

Oh yeah He loved his wife and they knew it She refused to go into the program You can't say that our Blamer All you get for your civic duty is a new birth certificate in $1,200 a month for a year and a half So why did he come forward?

I thought that was confidential It is, that's why I'm asking I don't know You didn't ask? He said it was for the job For the job or because of it She cops lose it all the time Need to get it off their chest We cheat on our spouses, we drink, even eat our guns We got her sand around the squad If you can get two shots off before the end You're real hard-ass He didn't kill himself Then how did he get powder burns on his hand? We have a test for that Camille We checked his reports He had to fight his weapon in weeks And it was broken glass outside the window If the perks broke in, the glass would have been on the floor We're not stupid He said you wouldn't know What time did you need the precinct? After everything that happened, you can't believe that I did this You didn't pull the trigger because the detective Williams said you were together Then why am I? Because you went to the regional town He swang was being held there before being moved to a safe house And somehow, you're pretty the last found that out I wasn't there Yes you were, because somebody had an idea for it all If I was with Williams, how do you explain it? Revenge Change, record, this was a little tired You know, you're not the only one with a quid, Jericho As of yesterday, we'll be together Williams, get back here Prove it Oh I will, and I can't And I got this I got it I guess I know how you feel, huh? The trade, used, then you get angry, right? And payback is the only thing that you can think about Until she becomes a bitch all of a sudden It's about right, isn't it? I mean, you played me well girl I mean, who else better than Vouchview's in a cop? It wasn't like that But this time I'll play you Right? Now you're right We can improve it You're gonna have to cooperate And trust me when I tell you, you will when I'm done with you I'm outta here You sit here, that's right here You're gonna have to bait you To tell him where to find Swain You told him how to Marshal's operate He ends up dead So whether or not you gave it to him for free Or you sold it to him You did it, we know it And you're gonna pay for that How Williams I'm gonna go to baits Just like you did And I'm gonna tell him we got you on two counts of conspiracy to murder US deputy Marshal's and one Kevin Swain Then I'm gonna tell him I'm gonna put you serve him up to us on a plate Well thank you, Paul String I will, Willie And you're willing to take that risk I don't believe you It's not just that Thank you Right Good Let me set Remember baits, no joke You just better make sure you cover my ass You're a protected witness Whether I like it or not I told you before we'll do anything to get baits So you can give you a deal Listen, the first is wired in the lining The page was back up Now the range isn't good on either one so we're gonna have to be close Just get the page to say something and premonating and then we'll come in I know what you mean Williams Can I have a minute? I never meant to hurt you I just couldn't let Swain get away again For me, ask for something If you get away with doing the same thing Then what makes you different than him? Look, I couldn't take the national interest anymore The snitches and the finks Double dipping between federal agencies There's been a $100 million dollar The snitches last year Swain was the last straw That's very noble, Erica I'd shred a book Hmm The reason why I chose you is because I knew you wouldn't need me twisting in the wind Most cops, they would never open their mouths about us It's not my morals that I question It's my taste Move your hands a little to the left, I might get something out of this too Just quit For a woman you travel very late Make up in the car, you want it? Some men appreciate a shop, waiting for a female I'm not one of them When we talked yesterday you didn't seem to mind I don't know what you're talking about I gave you a freebie You said butchers instead of somebody subtle So I'll get to the point I got cops asking me questions, I don't like it Snippers, some of them, if they're too young to say the damn thing we can use I could give you a loan to help you, straight out your problems Unfortunately, don't keep any cash in the car Come on, do something, rock How much we talking here I gave you Swains whereabouts Two marshals got killed How much you need Enough to get lost Fair enough Call my associate, he'll take care of you Look at how she doing Your plan, your witness is leaving She left one of the trans women in the office, we have to stay in range And now we do So where we going anyway You know what, I know this city like the back of my hand If you take half done you're gonna hit traffic So then we should turn on this street of people And we should eat this, you say? I've lost you really, I'm static I got a little help, don't worry about it This side, I understand Okay Don't take this person like the one I like people sitting behind you If you could just move around and push There they are, all units, that's exciting All units, now we're changing How do we go? Let's go, let's go Where is she going? Look at that, where is she? Where is she? Where is she? Where is she going? Where is she? Where is she? Where is she going? Where is she going? Where is she going? Where is she going? Where is she going? Where is she going? Where is she going? Here, we talking to you Stay safe Where is she going? Where is she going? Where is she going? You're done now Sit down Don, if you I wish you want to tell your story to one police plaza What difference does it make who I talk to? The girls in the report that you staged this whole thing The Brass won't be satisfied with just your resignation Did Officer Vincent take his own life? Maybe you forgot what it's like out there on the street. And how you gold shields don't show up till the smoke's cleared anyway. We're still gonna ask you out. Believe me. You don't see some guy beating the crap out of his wife? My wife's some kid who put her brains out. And you never find out why. So Ease has gotten lady to clean up his mess? He was my partner. What's this? Officer Todd Vincent died from a gunshot wound fired by an unknown salient. Hey, what's your? If you're looking for G. He went that way with Mickey. No, I thought I'd come see you and say hello. Hello. So, um... I'm going to see you. I'm going to see you. I'm going to see you. I'm going to see you. I'm going to see you. I'm going to see you. Hello. So, um... how have you been? I've been all right. I haven't seen you around in a while. Yeah. You know that woman who's working on that case? Yeah, Elyca. Well, she was killed. J.C., I'm so sorry. I have me, too. So I needed to, you know, just take time away. I know we didn't get off to the best start. So, what I want to try to do is make it up to you. I don't think that'll be a good idea. Why not? J.C., I don't always know what I want, but I know what I don't want. What, J.C.? Second place. Not over a woman. Not over a job. Nothing. Who's talking about second place? And then, you know, people settle. And that's not me. So... Friends? I'm Rosanna Scotto coming up next for the second time this week, a serious accident at a New York airport. We'll go inside the home of the cult of death, new details on how they took their own lives, plus their eerie final message. Why were they so concerned about a comet and some UFOs? Also ahead, Vi by Hyves Ventrophy, the judge tells OJ to pay up. There's a videotape that might help police find notorious BIGs killer. You'd better make sure you pay it all your tickets when you see this woman coming with her phone. This woman coming with her computer or else, why Charles Manson doesn't want to be free, and Martin Luther King Jr's son goes face to face with James Earl Ray. Put down that remote, the 10 o'clock news is next. We'll come to my world, call this a fast you stay.",

Yeah, I go. Oh, little part of time. Don't worry about time. I'll turn it up. Oh, my dog. I'm never. Oh, my dog. Oh, my dog. I'm never. Oh, my dog. Stop with my bad, your big brother. I'm never. Oh, my dog. What's in here? What? What? What? What? What? What? You're a shotgun blast to make a hold at large. What you got done in here? Your dealings is fugitives named Billy Lucas. Murder weapons, bags, and tag, and you should have. I'll put it in there next to my cruise. All I got to name, Herica Rockler. She called it in and waited. But she did pull the trigger. But she said I'll put it in on the air. I guess we've been for price. Thanks, Dunne. Slim, though. We got this. Thanks, fellas. So, uh, this rockline detective Williams is my partner in Detective Torres. You want to tell us what happened? I'll do Q&A at your precinct with my attorney present. I think said this if you continue to be violating my rights. I'm educated consumer, huh? I watch a lot of TV. All right. I'm between killing people. Is that a question to Williams? Not even close. Hey, Natasha. We hear him. We're going to the corner. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You did? That's the minute truck. I'm sure you can come down. Pick it up any time you need. No, that would be no trouble, though. I'll see you then. Oh, bye. Woo! Yo, Ed. She left her glasses. And this truck, I, she's going to come to pick them up. Well, she left was a big fat hen. Come on, man. What are you slipping now or something? You don't want it? Get it? Part B. Lieutenant, we got our perk. Her name is Eric, a rockweiss. She admitted to it and we got the weapon. And? It's an easy-close door. I don't know, gentlemen. What about motive? Oh, come on. We don't need that. We can statement her signature and ladies have done. Dean. Oh, just like that. Meanwhile, I heard that the Ben-Fuara went out on Billy Lucas two weeks ago, federal case, mixed bag of charges, counter-fitting through attempted murder. What's her role in this? Where does she fit in? What's her background? Well, she's not talking until the lawyer so is on. But all we got on her right now is that she's from North Carolina. She got three prior for being neat and again, charged. And does she do any time? No, they would drop. All right, well, you see where we might have some blanks to fill in here, gentlemen? So why don't we do that? And then we can wrap it up, all right? Yeah. All right, well, well, well. What do we got here? A mile to Jordan. He dropped us New York Attorney. She's ready to cooperate fully. Okay, I'll buy first. New York Attorney. What do you got one in every state now? Not yet. But if business picks up, I'll need more. What is this business that you do? Fugitive Retrait Ball. That almost sounds professional, huh? Well, let's be real. You're nothing but a damn bounty, honey. When the bill jumped a turn nasty, I had to take him down. It was him or me. Do I have stupid retina on my face? You expect me to buy that? No, you just don't like it. Well, that too. You see, you bounty hunters are not professionals. You don't even know what the hell you're doing up here. You're out of line, detective. My client came into town yesterday. She had certified copies of a bail agreement. She came in and she checked in with a desk sergeant downstairs. She went by the book. There is no book. That is the problem. So what really happened, Erica? He spooked you and then what? Boom, you have to shoot him. Is that what happened? I don't spook easily. And I don't get paid on corpses. Look, he took my gun. He had me on the ground. He was going to fire. I had no choice. Right, right. So how were you able to track him down so fast? Criminals are creatures of habit. Lucas had a thing for a hookah. So I just passed some cash around and waited for a never. So who ratted him out? I washed out Skink on time, square. She must have sold me out because a clown who I was coming. What's her name? Crystal. Crystal what? Shem Belair, how the hell am I supposed to know? She's a hookah. For a price you'll be any name you wanted to be. Enough of that. You make a decision. If you charge my client, we'll cut a loose. Yeah, well, that's it, gentlemen. Check the desk sergeancy if your story holds up. Lieutenant. Not what, Williams. Whether you like it or not, bounty hunting's illegal occupation. They are dangerous amateurs, Lieutenant. What about the people's rights? You just don't have any rights. They hand them over to the Bill Bond'sman who in turn gets it to the bounty hunter. Look, a man is dead. Now, he may have been a criminal, but she's the one that took his life. Yes, which only goes to support the argument that things went bad towards the end, Torres. Now, she had a lot to gain by bringing Lucas in alive. The hell of a way to make a living. What do we do now? Well, we make sure that CSU and the coroner agree on track. The coroner agree on trajectory load and buckshut spray. We cross every T dot every I. Sorry, I'm late. Don't sweat it, you covered. Cooper asked for me. She did indeed. What's your teller? You mail problems? What? It covers the myriad of elves. This way nobody asks me Jack. So where were you when you went? My attorneys. Anything wrong? I was catching. Your turn, I got the last one. Morena, fourth squad. Yep. Okay, you'll be right there. I got a shooting, Tommy. It's a car. It's nice surface. All right. Any of you not here as part of the investigation leave now. You're destroying the claim scene. How about I take the body? Offside on it you? Yeah. You need a few minutes or can you do this? No, no, look, the quick of the better. Now, how soon before the wagon gets here? I don't want to since wife seen it like this. It should be a soon. So what happened? We worked a late tour. We dropped them off as usual. I go home to crash. Camille, that's his wife. She calls me from her job. She's hysterical, and a panic. What about... She says they're talking on the phone and... Something he yells at somebody and then the phone went dead. She kept calling back but there was no answer. That's when you came over to check it out? Yeah, right. And I get here and... Take your time. The door was open and the mess and everything. It's a great time. Single shot to the head, close range. There was powder burns around the wound. I checked his pulse. I used my cell to call it in. It's been touched. Was there anything missing? It's gone. I don't know what else. We're going to have to ask Camille. I'm not. Yeah, what you got? Take a little... Okay, while there are any pictures, all angles right here. Hey! Hello? The motor live. And hello to you too. Have a seat. Are you looking good, girl? Is this what you need? Yeah. I'm always leaving those some. Hey, I'm a man. I hate to say this. Looks like old girl was right. Yeah. Ah, Natasha. This is my point of Eddie Torres. Oh, this is my French teacher. Oh, man. Right. You know what? I got a fun fight. Nice to meet you. My man. Joe, anyway, home. I just make a break. I'm outta here, Williams. What'd you do? Me? Nothing. Don't let him break you, honey. He's not gonna straighten no time. Didn't they tell you that you can go? So why don't you go? I'm after Lucas's pal, Kevin Swain. What did you do to know? Just in case. Who is that? Some... A trouble. Well, I'm gonna let you get back to work. All right, listen. What we should do, I don't know. What I think we should do, I mean, you should meet tonight. You'll have dinner with Snife Blame. Hello, Alex. Can you come? I'm gonna see they lock you up, Rock. Even if I have to do it myself. Nobody's calling me that long time. You murdered Billy Lucas. Oh, man. Listen, I'm warning you. Stay away from Kevin Swain. He's mine. Unless he's in shackles, he's up for a rant. No, not this time. We go way back, you, man. I don't wanna see you get hurt. I touched. Really? I'm gonna see you. I'm gonna see you. I'm gonna see you. I touched. Really? You think the fight is not too difficult? It was to detect his working on the case. Alex Pratt, Deputy US Marshal. How's it going? So what's this all about? Ericka Rockler. Lieutenant was telling me that so far this looks clean? What are you saying that it's not? I know it's not. Rock used to be one of us. She worked for the government. She was a Marshal. She was a good one too. Till she lost a witness in a treasury case. The two men suspected of orchestrating that particular horror show. Who Billy Lucas. And Kevin Swain. So you think that it's revenge? Absolutely. She lost her witness and her career. Not revenge. I'd say that's mild. Yes, sir. Alrighty, down. The feds say they're gonna send over that file on Kevin Swain as soon as possible. Which means never you got it. So BCI says the man's got 14 priors for four drinks. Buying a set of $2 million and like Lucas, a warrant with issue two weeks ago. Ericka bags him that's 200 G's in her pocket. That's a big payday. She's got a score to settle with this Lucas guy. Yeah, but we don't have any evidence to support America. Moadeth Ed. She lied to us. Five hundred. When we stopped with her snatch, Erica says that she sent her up, so maybe she want to ask why. Alright, we got a girl by the name of Crystal Wade, 110th and Pleasant. Where have you been? I know. You're hurting me. Where's Lucas? We have a meet in two hours. Yeah, Ed. What? What's that? Some bitch came sniffing around looking for both of you. So I called Lucas and told them about it. Shut up. No, I didn't. I swear I didn't. He told me to pay her and get her to come to the club. I just did what he said. I swear I didn't. I didn't. I wish she... Name's Erica. The cops locked her up. Where are you going? Shut up. What does that mean? I'm going with you. No, not. Yes, I am. Don't make this hardest wave. You won't survive. Ah! Shoot. You killed her. Whatever. But you, I need life. Hey, hold it, you! Back up! Club it! Put it down. He's mine. Mrs. Vincent. I'm sorry about your loss. Camille used to detect it so it'd be work in the case. I'm going to find a bastard. No, you're on the phone when this happened. Is that right? He always called me when he worked nights. I know he was all right. And what did you hear? A crash. Like something broke. Then Todd yelled and the phone went dead. Do you remember what he yelled? Okay. That's it? Would your husband suffer from depression? What difference does that make? We're just covering all the bases, Tony. You should know that. Man, was he having problems on the job? No. This is my husband. It's not unhappy. And he was not crazy. Does someone killed him or don't you care? Nice technique, Dennis. It's a hell of a way to treat one of you. You're off for the books, kid. How's that? Ben's worn a body for two mil. Uncle Sam must want you bad. I want to make a call. I'm entitled to a call. That's my right. Sure, no problem. I mean, as soon as we processed these other charges, murder, fake money, I mean, that pretty much guarantees you life. What do you want? Where'd you get the money? What do I get? I'm going to see the court, Anna. It's my own life, I guess. Sweeten the deal, I'll lead you right to him. Meet him on our riverside on the past. Me with whom? Deal first. No, you're in no position to bargain, baby. Well, maybe you should look at these senotes again, baby. They're supposed to be counterfeit proof. Tell you what. Why don't you call the feds. But they make a deal. We'll say. So tell you anything we can swing this? I'm going to talk to the state's attorney and see what we have to offer. Don't do this, Lieutenant. It's a mistake. You can't play federal games with local talent. Your opinion doesn't count. And I'm doing you a favor by even allowing you in here, Ms. Rocklar. Lieutenant, please. Let me take him in, just to consort out the rest. Now, what you really want? You pal' Pratt and the feds tell a difference. I knew Alex Pratt would fill you in. He used you. Oh, really? How? Third one of the way. See, Mama would've his strictly money. He is his prestige. He brings Tween in first. Hell, even Jenna Reena would have to take notice. Let me take him in. I have to surrender him to the sheriff to collect my fee. Sorry, this is going to go down our way. Set her up, Williams. Listen, Eric. I'm so okay, Lanc. I already know how to bend over.rey DON Liu. Pardon me? Can you hear me? What's going on, bates? I heard your legal battle, has escalated! The legal battle has escalated. Yeah, that's why I'm here. My buyer's real interested in your flights. Of course. Come on, you're not going to try to jack the price up on me, guys. Kevin, the free market is not for neophytes. When you're in trouble, you need to steal. I don't. When this bait says something concrete, he's going to want. Yeah, but you know he's going to be careful. You've got to get out of town. I'll let you know. Company. Damn, he made us. Let's go. Terrick, I found she doing it. What the hell are you doing? Get my money. Let's go. Move it now, King. Do not shoot. Purpose, fun or... Go. Go. Go. Go on. You guys, back off, gentlemen. That's the federal highway. It's waiting, man. He is protecting Wittings. Look at him. Right here. What the hell are you doing? My job. I just signed out. It's going on. There you are. Two years work down the drain because your detectives couldn't master surveillance 101. Watch how you talk about my men, Pratt, alright? And you're in no position to throw stones because you didn't even tell me that there was a federal operation going on in my jurisdiction. It wasn't my call. I protect the witness. That's it. Yeah, son of a bitch, Alex. Kenneth Swain murdered a witness under our protection and you gave that low-life snitch a deal. You have no evidence to prove that and frankly, Rock, if you remember, there is nothing more important than the national interest. You already lost your star over this, let it go. I need some air. Oh, yeah. Look, I don't like this anymore than you do, but the fact is we need bait to get Russell Gates at money. At money, it's the straights we won't recover for years. Yeah, right. So you're saying this promotion that you get for bringing a man is just gravy, right? We're bearing the soapbox detective. You're willing to make a deal with Swain to get a bait yourself. I was ready to send him to jail. Not to some beach with a new idea and a pocket full of money. Most criminals went to the program due time first. He's not going to do a day in time if it's up to you. I mean besides, we've got solid proof against your boyfriend murder. A man can't stand trial if he no longer exists. Lou, come on. Please let it go, Torres. We should have processed him while we had him. Possessions 9-10 for the war. Hey, Matt. The um, the parent intense on officer Vincent came back and conclusive. CSUs that there were too many astringent chemicals present. Like what? The beach would do it. From dust your strength cleaners. It's just suspicious enough that he's an adult washed. No, well, not if he just came out of the shower. It was washed in dishes. Thanks. Thank you. Let's go out of here. Is Detective Williams here? He'll be down in a sec. Pocket. So, what'd you do this time? I gave it to him. I knew the system wasn't perfect, but I thought it worked. You're a cop? Not anymore. I don't want to end up a drunk or a plane with muddun in the dark. Sorry. Don't waste that on me. Save that for the poor slugs like Williams. They need you, pity. I haven't known JC very long, but he does not seem like the kind of man anyone should feel sorry for. Not yet, but it's coming. He's got that cop disease. Oh, my God, I know what you're talking about. Did JC once tell me something? I prefer he told me on his own. Hmm. Then you're in for a long wait. I see cops don't talk to anybody else but cops. Wise and girlfriends. They don't know Jack until they come home and there's brains about it all over the wall. You're exaggerating. What do you say? Look, the job comes first. He can't sell dates, unanswered questions, mood swings. And if you have kids with cops, you can count on raising them young damn self. Mm-hmm. If there's one thing I know about JC, is that he takes a big part in raising his son. We'll have you ever talk to the boys and mother. I'm sure she might sing a different tone. You obviously don't know him. I know him better than you do and I'm just a madam. Give JC a message for me. Tell him not to let it get to me. If he wants you to know, it'll tell you. Oh, no. All right. Something wrong? Hey, yeah. I'm sorry. I meant to call you. That's okay. Don't worry about it. What happened? Just this case I'm working on. You know, the whole thing went bust. It's even a bad taste to my mouth. Well, I'm a good listener if you want somebody to talk to. Oh, thanks. Okay. Well, I'll tell you later. I'll do. Oh, yeah. That girl that was here earlier. Where are you? Yeah. She told me to tell you don't let it get to you. She said that, huh? Yeah, she's one to talk. Did she say where she was going? Sorry. We're going. See you later. Listen. This one shouldn't know I really did want to see you tonight. Yeah, me too. All right. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going.

You have no business poking around in my fight Crack gave this to me, okay? What does he have against you anyway? I was his partner And I never told him that our witness had contact with the relative I lost my job and Alex lost a promotion So is that the reason why your witness was killed? Oh yeah He loved his wife and they knew it She refused to go into the program You can't say that our Blamer All you get for your civic duty is a new birth certificate in $1,200 a month for a year and a half So why did he come forward? Because he was a damn fool Who didn't know?

Around 11 o'clock last night A woman massing Erica's description was seen at the hotel I want to know what points out on her And I want this mess cleared up before the breast or a comb It wasn't her Williams I know how you feel She's been through it and then some But now it's out of my hands I know that it wasn't her Because she was with me last night What's with you? Yeah, she was with me Where is she now? She's at our hotel Don't get it towards us What? What? I told you everything that I knew You yelled hey, you know we got that Now there wasn't much missing from your place Maybe they got scared when I shut my husband Why was Officer Vincent seeing a police drink? I thought that was confidential It is, that's why I'm asking I don't know You didn't ask? He said it was for the job For the job or because of it She cops lose it all the time Need to get it off their chest We cheat on our spouses, we drink, even eat our guns We got her sand around the squad If you can get two shots off before the end You're real hard-ass He didn't kill himself Then how did he get powder burns on his hand? We have a test for that Camille We checked his reports He had to fight his weapon in weeks And it was broken glass outside the window If the perks broke in, the glass would have been on the floor We're not stupid He said you wouldn't know What time did you need the precinct? After everything that happened, you can't believe that I did this You didn't pull the trigger because the detective Williams said you were together Then why am I? Because you went to the regional town He swang was being held there before being moved to a safe house And somehow, you're pretty the last found that out I wasn't there Yes you were, because somebody had an idea for it all If I was with Williams, how do you explain it? Revenge Change, record, this was a little tired You know, you're not the only one with a quid, Jericho As of yesterday, we'll be together Williams, get back here Prove it Oh I will, and I can't And I got this I got it I guess I know how you feel, huh? The trade, used, then you get angry, right? And payback is the only thing that you can think about Until she becomes a bitch all of a sudden It's about right, isn't it? I mean, you played me well girl I mean, who else better than Vouchview's in a cop? It wasn't like that But this time I'll play you Right? Now you're right We can improve it You're gonna have to cooperate And trust me when I tell you, you will when I'm done with you I'm outta here You sit here, that's right here You're gonna have to bait you To tell him where to find Swain You told him how to Marshal's operate He ends up dead So whether or not you gave it to him for free Or you sold it to him You did it, we know it And you're gonna pay for that How Williams I'm gonna go to baits Just like you did And I'm gonna tell him we got you on two counts of conspiracy to murder US deputy Marshal's and one Kevin Swain Then I'm gonna tell him I'm gonna put you serve him up to us on a plate Well thank you, Paul String I will, Willie And you're willing to take that risk I don't believe you It's not just that Thank you Right Good Let me set Remember baits, no joke You just better make sure you cover my ass You're a protected witness Whether I like it or not I told you before we'll do anything to get baits So you can give you a deal Listen, the first is wired in the lining The page was back up Now the range isn't good on either one so we're gonna have to be close Just get the page to say something and premonating and then we'll come in I know what you mean Williams Can I have a minute? I never meant to hurt you I just couldn't let Swain get away again For me, ask for something If you get away with doing the same thing Then what makes you different than him? Look, I couldn't take the national interest anymore The snitches and the finks Double dipping between federal agencies There's been a $100 million dollar The snitches last year Swain was the last straw That's very noble, Erica I'd shred a book Hmm The reason why I chose you is because I knew you wouldn't need me twisting in the wind Most cops, they would never open their mouths about us It's not my morals that I question It's my taste Move your hands a little to the left, I might get something out of this too Just quit For a woman you travel very late Make up in the car, you want it? Some men appreciate a shop, waiting for a female I'm not one of them When we talked yesterday you didn't seem to mind I don't know what you're talking about I gave you a freebie You said butchers instead of somebody subtle So I'll get to the point I got cops asking me questions, I don't like it Snippers, some of them, if they're too young to say the damn thing we can use I could give you a loan to help you, straight out your problems Unfortunately, don't keep any cash in the car Come on, do something, rock How much we talking here I gave you Swains whereabouts Two marshals got killed How much you need Enough to get lost Fair enough Call my associate, he'll take care of you Look at how she doing Your plan, your witness is leaving She left one of the trans women in the office, we have to stay in range And now we do So where we going anyway You know what, I know this city like the back of my hand If you take half done you're gonna hit traffic So then we should turn on this street of people And we should eat this, you say? I've lost you really, I'm static I got a little help, don't worry about it This side, I understand Okay Don't take this person like the one I like people sitting behind you If you could just move around and push There they are, all units, that's exciting All units, now we're changing How do we go? Let's go, let's go Where is she going? Look at that, where is she? Where is she? Where is she? Where is she going? Where is she? Where is she? Where is she going? Where is she going? Where is she going? Where is she going? Where is she going? Where is she going? Where is she going? Here, we talking to you Stay safe Where is she going? Where is she going? Where is she going? You're done now Sit down Don, if you I wish you want to tell your story to one police plaza What difference does it make who I talk to? The girls in the report that you staged this whole thing The Brass won't be satisfied with just your resignation Did Officer Vincent take his own life? Maybe you forgot what it's like out there on the street. And how you gold shields don't show up till the smoke's cleared anyway. We're still gonna ask you out. Believe me. You don't see some guy beating the crap out of his wife? My wife's some kid who put her brains out. And you never find out why. So Ease has gotten lady to clean up his mess? He was my partner. What's this? Officer Todd Vincent died from a gunshot wound fired by an unknown salient. Hey, what's your? If you're looking for G. He went that way with Mickey. No, I thought I'd come see you and say hello. Hello. So, um... I'm going to see you. I'm going to see you. I'm going to see you. I'm going to see you. I'm going to see you. I'm going to see you. Hello. So, um... how have you been? I've been all right. I haven't seen you around in a while. Yeah. You know that woman who's working on that case? Yeah, Elyca. Well, she was killed. J.C., I'm so sorry. I have me, too. So I needed to, you know, just take time away. I know we didn't get off to the best start. So, what I want to try to do is make it up to you. I don't think that'll be a good idea. Why not? J.C., I don't always know what I want, but I know what I don't want. What, J.C.? Second place. Not over a woman. Not over a job. Nothing. Who's talking about second place? And then, you know, people settle. And that's not me. So... Friends? I'm Rosanna Scotto coming up next for the second time this week, a serious accident at a New York airport. We'll go inside the home of the cult of death, new details on how they took their own lives, plus their eerie final message. Why were they so concerned about a comet and some UFOs? Also ahead, Vi by Hyves Ventrophy, the judge tells OJ to pay up. There's a videotape that might help police find notorious BIGs killer. You'd better make sure you pay it all your tickets when you see this woman coming with her phone. This woman coming with her computer or else, why Charles Manson doesn't want to be free, and Martin Luther King Jr's son goes face to face with James Earl Ray. Put down that remote, the 10 o'clock news is next. We'll come to my world, call this a fast you stay."

Julian Dick im End? Jasu von Championships! Quint P heartel da sind wir Wir kommen nicht keiner, cu\u00e1nt\u766e dass ihr das wollt Und schon sind wir da! Na wie weit sind Sie Mr. Wodjas? Gleich f\u00e4hrt ich Mrs. Kirin. Gut! Na wie weit sind Sie Mr. Wodjas? Gleich f\u00e4hrt ich Mrs. Kirin. Gut! Judith! Tut, tut! Mach die doch bitte schon mal fertig! Und vielleicht r\u00e4umst du auch noch mal was? Tut! Tut! Mach dich doch bitte schon mal fertig! Und vielleicht r\u00e4umst du auch was? Und vielleicht r\u00e4umt's auch dein Zimmer, ob sie m\u00fcssen jeden Moment hier sein. Wie weit ist es noch, Sch\u00f6ne? Vielleicht noch eine Meile. Vom Bahnhof aus der Feriengef\u00e4hr 5 Meilen gefahren. Ist ja nicht zu glauben, endlich geht's mal weg ab. Ist ja auch sch\u00f6n hier, was? Ja, ja, und toll noch. Kuck doch mal das Meer. Das da dr\u00fcben ist bestimmt K\u00f6rn ein. Oha, m\u00fcsste's einigen. Was sind das von komischer Tohem? Keine Ahnung. Aber Ginny wei\u00df das bestimmt. Nose, wir wollen wenigstens punktlich sein. George! Georgina! Also wirklich, Georgina. Georgina! Komm hier! Das muss es sein. Los! Entschuldigung, sie bitte. Ist das die Kernkottage? Und wie so bist du das Wissen? Wir sind Verwandte von Georgina. Ihre Mutter hat uns eingeladen. Eine Lausibande hat Professor Kirin noch gefehlt. Und drei mehr, die herum Wimmeln leer machen und in meiner Arbeit st\u00f6ren. Er hat verdammt es Gl\u00fcck, dass er meistens auf der Insel ist. Dann hat er wohl diesen komischen Tohem gebaut. Ja, etwas mit seinem Experiment zu tun. Ist aber streng geheim klar. Also seht er euch vor und blaut er nicht mit fremden Leuten dar\u00fcber. Und lasst euch ja nicht in einem meiner Gem\u00fcsebehintervischen. Gem\u00fcse bitte, wof\u00fcr \u00e4lter uns denn f\u00fcr Kanickl. Ach, da seid ihr ja. Ist aber sch\u00f6n euch mal wieder zu sehen. Fachpante Fanny. Hier seid ihr auch schon ein bisschen Zeit, ich euch das letzte Mal gesehen hab. Endbar damals noch ein Baby. Wartet mal. Du m\u00fcsstest Julien sein und das ist dick. Na wie war die Reise? Einfach klasse, Tante Fanny. Die fahrt vom Bahnhof hierher, war doch prima. Na gut, ich hab beim Bahnhof angerufen, euer Gepeck wird hergebracht. Stell die Fahrer hinter das Haus, gleich gibt's Tee. Ihr habt doch bestimmt auch Hunger. Ich stell ja die Beine auf dem Rad gefallen. Besonders Ende, was so sprach, dass sie sich immer den Kopf gehalten hat. Der fehlt irgendwie wieder Mine. Ich w\u00fcrde sagen, ihr seid ja sehr gefreut. Und jetzt kann man noch fahren und fahren. Wunderbarer nachmittag. Wunderbarer nachmittag. Ja, ich muss ja auch sagen, Mr. Dunsen. Ich hoffe, sie haben gut gespeisert. Das habe ich. Es wurde nur ein bisschen zu viel geriert. Es wird Zeit f\u00fcr eine sch\u00f6ne Tasse B\u00fcro-Tee. Oh je. Ja. Miss Peter, ich muss umfache gesehen, auf Weise f\u00fcr ein paar Tage wegfahren. Ich bin sicher, der Minister wird bis zum Err\u00fcck her auch ohne mich auskommen. Wir lassen Sie bitte den Wagen vorfahren, Miss Peter. Ja, ich bin der Johnson. Ich muss umfache gesehen, auf Weise f\u00fcr ein paar Tage wegfahren. Ich bin sicher, der Minister wird bis zum Err\u00fcck her auch ohne mich auskommen. Wir lassen Sie bitte den Wagen vorfahren, Miss Peter. Dankesch\u00f6n. Ich hab mir gedacht, morgen fahren wir alle auf die Insel. Und essen zu Mittag mit Onkel Quentin. Wo sind Jordina Tante, Fennel? Wir haben uns schon so auf sie gefreut. Was auch nicht vor sie ist. Also George verschwindet immer gerade dann, wenn sie es nicht soll. Aber wie so nennt sie George? Sie will es so. Aber jeder denkt an sie ist ein Junge und kein M\u00e4dchen. Anschein, wer sie es nicht anders. Also ich m\u00f6chte nicht, dass man denkt, ich w\u00e4re ein Junge. Nein, nat\u00fcrlich nicht. Aber du bist ja auch nicht wie George. Ach, dass du dich auch mal sehen l\u00e4sst. Wir haben fast alles aufgegessen. Ich hab keinen Hunger, danke Mutter. Willst du nicht guten Tag sagen? Das sind End, Dick und Julian. Hallo. Tag. Hallo. Hallo. Warum gehst du nicht mit Ihnen raus, George? Und zeig sie ein bisschen die Gegend. Aber ich muss doch noch. Ja, was? Was musst du? Nichts. Dann ist es sehr gut. Also ab mit euch. Ich r\u00e4umte den Tisch ab. Danke f\u00fcr den Tante, Fennel. Der Wohne ich war auch ganz viel Spa\u00df, Kinder. H\u00f6rt mal. Kommt nicht zu sp\u00e4t zur\u00fcck. Nein, nein. Tante, Fennel hat gesagt, wir wurden auf Wangel, k\u00f6nnt die ins Insel fahren. Sie m\u00fcssen das nicht klassisch, George. Meine Name ist nicht George. Ich hei\u00dfe George. Und die Insel geh\u00f6rt nicht ihm, sondern mir. Was riehst du dich denn gleich auf? Sie geh\u00f6rt mir. Er hat sie mir geschenkt. Und jetzt arbeitet ihr da und l\u00e4sst mich \u00fcberhaupt nicht mehr hin. Aber wenn seine Arbeit ein gro\u00dfes Geheimnis ist, warum macht ihr sie dann an einem Ort, wo jeder hinkommen kann, wenn er will? Du kannst es mal versuchen, die Klippen vor der Insel machen aus deinem Boot Kleinholz. Nur Vater und ich wissen, wie man da durchkommt. Er ist dort, weil die Gezeiten f\u00fcr seine Experimente braucht. Deshalb ist er auf meiner Insel. Also das finde ich auch prima meiner eigenen Insel zu sein. H\u00f6rt mal. Ich hab jetzt was zu erledigen. Das geht nur mich, was an Verstanden. Also, komm, wir blo\u00dfen hinterher geschlichen. Keiner von euch. Wir haben was, was was zu tun. Was kann er lustig werden mit dir? Daf\u00fcr ist es ja nicht weiter schlimm, aber ich muss mit ihr in einem Zimmer schlafen. Ich sage euch, das werden bestimmt zwei Verdammt lang gewohnt. F\u00fcr uns. Darf ich ihn noch eins bringen? Warum nicht, wenn es bezahlen kann? Oh, das sind wir mehr entvergl\u00fcgen. Bitte? Danke. Jimmy! Jimmy! Und komm, Jimmy, komm, na los, komm! Na komm, mein kleiner Achter. Das ist die Kleine von Quentin Kirin, nicht wahr? Ja. Wie ist Wielder als ein Junge? Und die meisten hier sagen, nur George zu ihr zum Wohl. Zum Wohl. Und das da ist ihr Hund. Der Professor wollte den Hund nicht im Haus haben. Sie soll den Weg geben, aber an dem K\u00f6ther h\u00e4ngt sie mehr als ein Allmandern. Der Sergensivo ist Quentin jetzt. Ich hab ihn lange nicht mehr gesehen. Ah, hat sich fast v\u00f6llig auf die Insel zur\u00fcckgezogen, experimentiert. Dann kommt \u00fcberhaupt nicht mehr r\u00fcber. Seine Frau bringt alles, was er braucht, zur Insel r\u00fcber. Vorher muss er bei mir das Signalisieren, dass alles in Ordnung ist. Dann blinkt er dreimal vom Tour mit einer Taschenlappe. Jeden Morgen und jeden Abend um 11. Danach k\u00f6nnen sie ihre Urstellen. Jeder hat seine Marottin. Ist das nicht verr\u00fcckt, so viel zu arbeiten? Los! Komm, jede Felsw\u00fcr! Wenn sich George hin und nur nicht sofort verbl\u00f6d ben\u00e4hen wurde. Sag blo\u00df George zu hier. Und zuletzt um es, muss morgen das Eis bezahlen. Das sagst du nur, weil ich so eine Sofa-Leberung. Sieht ja sehr einsam aus. Hey, seht mal! Sieht aus, als w\u00e4re das eine gro\u00dfe H\u00f6hle. Kommt mal her. Da kann man nicht viel sehen. Kommt, wir gehen mal tiefer rein. Wir k\u00f6nnen auch nicht ohne Taschenland bereingehen. Gut, da gehen wir zur\u00fcck und holen uns eine. Daf\u00fcr reicht die Zeit nicht. Wiss dir, was wir morgen noch mal her untersuchen, sie dann? Klar, sie l\u00e4uft uns ja nicht weg. Bewartet mal. Wir behalten das aber f\u00fcr uns. George hat hier geheimnis und diese H\u00f6hle ist nur unser Geheimnis. Okay? Okay. Oh, hallo, Kinder. Ihr seid doch zu Besuch auf Karen Kattetsch nicht wahr? Ja, das stimmt. Ist George nicht mitgekommen? Nein. Oh ja, Onkel und Euretantes sind gute Freunde von mir. Ich wollte ihr morgen nicht bei mir Tee trinken. Na ja, ich wei\u00df noch nicht, was wir morgen. Na ja, ist der egal, Komponier lostackt. Ich will mich freuen. Wiedersehen. Komischer Kauts. Das f\u00fcr mich ist nur so von merkw\u00fcrdigen Leuten. Habt ihr Fanny's der einzige normale Mensch, der mir hier bisher begegnet ist? Onkel, Quentin scheint dir wohl auch ein bisschen komisch zu sein. Ja, das werden wir morgen feststellen, auf die Insel nicht wahr? Ja, ob ich rudern, George? Nein, die Gl\u00f6ben f\u00fchlt sich okay, aber abliegen da. N\u00e4chste! NYJ pressuresf\u65f6ruh collaborations Was ist Frau, Giyet remains in\ufffd\ufffd Oster. Federt usw. Wy \u2013 \u0441\u0447el und Wien Wir sind der Warrior Das sind Grills sandwichs tiefer Rockzdrehen. Entschuldigung. Deriesz mit kleinem Bombang, George nimmt die Jungs mit und seht, ob ihr ihn findet. Okay, komm! Ich wollte schon noch sie essen. Vater! Vater! Nein, zu was habe ich ja noch nie gesehen? Sieht durch das an! Sag mal, George, wei\u00dft du, was das f\u00fcr Dinger sind da oben am Ton? Ich k\u00f6nnte mir vorstellen, dass das irgendwas mit Sonnenenergie zu tun hat. Die Reflektoren oder wieder zeichstehen vielleicht beanders. Vater! Vater! Ihr ist wohl nicht da oben. Irgendwo muss er doch sein. Hier bin ich! Der Professor K\u00f6rin, ihre Insel scheint ja ziemlich aufmerksamkeit zu erregen. Du bist gewachsen seit dem letzten Mal. Das war vor acht Jahren angequent denn? Ach wirklich? Dann war es ja wohl zu erwarten oder was meinst du? Wo treibst du dich denn im Moment auf der Insel rum? In den Kellern. Unter den Ruinen, die Keller vom alten Schloss. Sag mal, ist das dein Geheimlerbohr? Ja, wenn man will, kann man so nennen. K\u00f6nnen wir sich George auch anst\u00e4ndig um euch? Sie hat uns rausgerudert, um die gef\u00e4hrlichen Kleppen rum. Alle Achtung, die kann rudern. Das hei\u00dft, ein Junge, was? So, jetzt muss ich erstmal zur\u00fcck. Ich hab dann noch was zu kontrollieren. Danke f\u00fcr den Nachschub. George, du kannst deine Insel bald zur\u00fcck haben. Ich bin so gut wie fertig. Und wer gehst sie signale mich? Ich mach mir sonst auch. Nein, ich denke dran. Haben sie sie doch noch gut? Also dann wiedersehen. Na, Siegelsen! Sie da, Sie da! Eine reizende \u00dcberraschung, sie wieder zu sehen k\u00f6nnten. Chancen! Ich nehme an, Sie beobachten seltene Wasserf\u00f6gel nicht wahr? Was f\u00fcr ein hervorragendes Teleskop. Ja, das ist ein ausgetzeichnetes Fernrohr. Ach, sagen Sie mir f\u00fcr wen arbeiten Sie denn diesmal? Russland, China, Amerika? Damals als wir uns das letzte Mal beliegneten waren Sie f\u00fcr uns sehr unbequien k\u00f6rten. Ich hoffe, dass Sie sich dar\u00fcber klar sind. Sie, ich arbeite f\u00fcr niemanden, ich kippe Ihnen mein Wort. Ihr Wort. Ach, wenn das kein Funkger\u00e4t ist, will ich sofort tot umfallen. So, das reicht. Legt eure Schimmelsten rein. So und du tr\u00e4gst das. So, krank Kinder. George, was machst du denn heute nachmittag? Was ist ja von meiner Sache? Ich habe nur gedacht, wer wir interessantes gefunden haben. Was denn? Das ist unser Geheimnis. Wie sind du denn im H\u00fcgel am Ende vom Strand? Du kannst es dir noch mal \u00fcberlegen. Das ist wirklich eine tolle Sache, was wir da gefunden haben. George, komm! K\u00fcrzen, sind Sie da? Was ist los f\u00fcr den? Ich habe aber sein Wochenkane-Informationen mehr von Ihnen bekommen. Ich verstehe sie nicht, dass Sie mir den wieder Gesch\u00e4fte machen. Hallo, Karne. Hier schauen Sie, wie sch\u00f6n mal Ihre Stimme zu h\u00f6ren. Ich habe das Gef\u00fchl, Ihre T\u00e4tigkeit ist Ihnen dann unangenehmes Stadion getreten, mein Ver\u00e4rter. Pech f\u00fcr Sie. Auch \u00fcbrigens noch was. Sie werden Mr. K\u00f6rten auf der Frequenz nicht mehr empfangen. Kommen Sie. Wir sind sich wohl dar\u00fcber klar, dass Sie Unern\u00e4mlichkeiten bekommen. Zuerst einmal werden wir beide uns gr\u00fcndlich unterhalten. Ich glaube, hier ist schon eblich keiner mehr gewesen. Man kann nicht mal das Ende sehen. Die muss unheimlich weit reingehen. Kommt. Das ist keine H\u00f6hle. Das ist ein Tunnel, die noch jemand gebaut hat. Der ist ja unheimlich lang. Hier geht sich weiter bis unschneinz mehr. Was ist denn das? Das ist ein Hund. Hey, wir bist du denn? Wenn der wo geh\u00f6rt. Keine Ahnung, vielleicht die Unw\u00e4nden auf Strand. Jimmy, Jimmy, wo bist du? Das ist doch jordlich. Ich h\u00f6r mal nicht richtig. Das ist also jetzt tolles Geheimnis. Kommt. Jimmy, wie oft habe ich die schon gesagt, dass du keine Kaininchen jagen sollst? F\u00fcr Sie mich gef\u00e4lligst an, wenn ich die was sage. Mach dir in einartiger Hund zu was. Du bist ein ganz schlimmer. Komm jetzt. Muss man dir denn alles tausend mal sagen? Hallo, George. Dick. Was ist also, Jimmy? Wo wei\u00dft du denn sein Namen? Du hast dir noch gerade gerufen. Der hat uns einen gro\u00dfen Schreck eingehrt. Der ist dir wirklich s\u00fc\u00df, George, geh\u00f6rte dir? Ja. Und warum haben wir noch nicht im Haus gesehen? Vater hat mir verboten, ihn zu behalten, aber ein junger, am Dorf versorgt ihn f\u00fcr mich. Ich w\u00fcrde lieber vorhungern, als das sich im Weg gehen w\u00fcrde. Und au\u00dferdem halte ich es ohne ihn auch nicht aus. Ach, jetzt kapiere ich, dass deshalb paust du also so viel ab. Aber du brauchst keine Angst zu haben. Wir verraten dein Geheimnis nicht. Ganz bestimmt nicht George. Verspricht er mir da. Ja, wie versprechen das. Uns gef\u00e4llt dir doch genauso gut wie dir. Freunde? Freunde. Ich fand das sowieso nicht gut, dass wir Freunde waren. Was ich dir noch sagen wollte, George. Der Tunnel, den wir gefunden haben, das ist kein normaler Tunnel. Sehr weit sind wir nicht gekommen, aber wir haben ein paar Stufen gefunden. Ja, die f\u00fchren direkt in die Erde. Und ein Richtung zum Meer raus. Kommst du mit? Na klar, kommt. Hallo, Kinder. Na was ist nur mit meiner Einladung? Gehen wir lieber bevor ihr uns fragt, dass wir hier unten suchen. Ja, ich hab sowieso Hunger. Okay, wir kommen. Komm rein, mach's euch bequem. Das ist euch hier. Entschuldig, das ist ein bisschen unaufger\u00e4umtisch. Hint, seht euch mal das Fernrohr an. Oh ja, das ist mein Hobby. Ich beobachte V\u00f6gel. Karin Island. Oh, ich kann ja ungelquenten Sturm ganz deutlich sehen. Eine Arta-Abend, B\u00fcrokorax. Selten eine K\u00fcstenv\u00f6gel, ein paar davon hab ich auf der Insel ersp\u00e4t. Ja, und euch hab ich nat\u00fcrlich auch gesehen. Na, wie geht es denn deinem Vater? Meinem Vater auch hier. Er ist fast fertig, hatte gesagt. Ah, ist da das? Ja. Der gute alte Quentin. Nun ja. Vielleicht k\u00f6nnte die im erhebenden Tisch dicken. Ein bisschen Kuchen und Kekse sind dort drin. Ich mach inzwischen den Tee. Nicht da oben. Du findest alles in dem Unterrittfach, mein Junge. Oh, Entschuldigung. Ach, du meine G\u00fcte. Die Tante. Ich meine, meine Tante, Tante-John. Sie kommt zum Tee. Habt ihr das vergessen? Sie kennen sie doch sicher. Oh ja, nat\u00fcrlich, ja. Die Tame ist wirklich reizend. Ich hab ihm ein leider gleich weg. Tut mir leid. Auf Wiedersehen und vielen Dank. Ich schau aber. Es ist wirklich b\u00fcrt von uns. Entschuldigen sie bitte. Trotzdem vielen Dank. Auf Wiedersehen. Na ja, dann vielleicht ein Andermal. Wer ist denn Tante-John? Wir haben \u00fcberhaupt keine Tante-John. Nat\u00fcrlich nicht, aber trotzdem hat er gesagt, er kennt sie. Der tut nur, soll's w\u00e4re ein Freund von Vater. Aber ich hab den Karl noch niemals vorgesehen. Du h\u00e4ttest ihn nicht sagen d\u00fcrfen, dass Vater fast fertig ist. Du wei\u00dft genau, dass das geheim ist. Ich schliebe mir leid, Jot. Ich hab mich dran gedacht. Meinst du nicht \u00fcbertreibst die Sachen ein bisschen, Jot? Nein, ich glaub, sie hat recht. Du hast bestimmt nicht gesehen, was in dem Schrankt. Da war ein Funkr\u00e4t, ein ziemlich gro\u00dfes Oh Mann. Wirklich ausgezeichnet, K\u00f6rten. Und ja, es tut mir leid, ich... Sie waren so pl\u00f6tzlich weg. Ich konnte \u00fcberhaupt keine Fragen stellen. Ich hab alles geh\u00f6rt, was ich wissen wollte. Professor Kirin ist also, wie der Junge sagte, fast fertig. Nicht zu verbissen K\u00f6rten. Sie haben noch eine Menge Vorh\u00e4ute nach. Ja, vielleicht. Trotzdem glaube ich, dass wir uns viel zu viel Gedanken machen. Solange ungequend die noch p\u00fcnktlich signalisiert. Es ist gleich ab 11. Oh, das fliegt sehr viel k\u00fcrzierlich. Das fliegt ja \u00fcber die Insel. Habt ihr seinen Zeichen schon gesehen, Kinder? Nein, noch nicht. Muss jeden Moment kommen. Mach schon Vater los. Da. Eins. Zwei. Drei. Alles in Ordnung, George. Nichts passiert. Es ist alles in Ordnung, Kantifenni. Gut. Jetzt ab ins Weg mit euch. Mach, mach. Puder bin ich aber erleichtert. Aber morgen fr\u00fch werde ich jetzt essen, den Turm mit einem Fahrenglas beobachten. Gute Nacht. Guten Nacht. Nacht. Nacht. Nacht. Ah. Professor Kirin, n\u00e4mlich an. Wer zum Teufel sind Sie? Ich glaube kaum, dass ich mich kenn' mein Name ist Johnson. Ich bin vom Forschungsministerium. Gott sei Dank, Mr. Johnson. Im ersten Moment habe ich geglaubt, Sie lehren zu was wir sagen. Das ist nicht wahr beim Forschungsministerium. Denn k\u00fcrzlich habe ich beschlossen, ein eigenes Ministerium auch zu machen. Verstehen Sie? Und dies ist der Anfang, Professor. Der beste, den ich mir denken kann. Hier auf Kirin Island. Was hinterverbotenen T\u00fcren aufsteckt? Wir kennen kein Zur\u00fcck. Es wird vor uns entdeckt. Wir lassen uns keine Gefalle. Wir k\u00f6nnen uns wieder stehen. Und Freunde, das sind wir. Zu ihr Digpo-N, Johnson, Tell mir ihr Hoh. Und Freunde, das sind wir. Wir kommen schneller bei. Und immer ihr das Wort. Wir kommen schneller bei. Und schon sind wir da. Sind wir da. Und immer ihr das Wort. Wir kommen schneller bei. Und schon sind wir da. Sind wir da.",

We don't know them because we're used to them, where there's always a puzzle to solve, high up in the old castle or Schwoglammess, if that's us. Julian Dick in the end? Jasu from Championships! Quint P heartel here we are We're not coming, nobody knows that you want that And here we are! Well, how far are you, Mr. Wodjas? I'll be leaving shortly, Mrs. Kirin. Good!

And maybe you could tidy something up too? And maybe you could tidy your room too, they should be here any minute. How far is it, beautiful? Maybe another mile. From the train station, the holidaymakers drove about 5 miles. I can't believe it, things are finally getting going. It's beautiful here, isn't it? Yes, yes, and still great. Just look at the sea. That over there must be grain. Oh, it should be enough. What kind of strange thing is that? I have no idea. But Ginny will definitely know. Nose, we at least want to be on time. George! Georgina! Really, Georgina. Georgina! Come here! That has to be it. Go on! Excuse me, please. Is this the Kernkottage? And how did you get the knowledge? We are relatives of Georgina. Her mother invited us. Professor Kirin was just missing a bunch of rascals. And three more who are swarming around and disturbing my work. He's damn lucky that he's on the island most of the time. Then he must have built this strange thing. Yes, something to do with his experiment. But it's top secret, of course. So be careful and don't talk about it with strangers. And don't get caught in one of my vegetable stalls. Vegetables, please, what are we for rabbits? Oh, there you are. It's nice to see you again. Aunt Fanny. You've been here for a while since I last saw you. You were just a baby then. Wait a minute. You must be Julien and that's fat. So how was the trip? Simply brilliant, Aunt Fanny. The ride here from the station was great. OK, I called the station, your food is being brought here. Put the drivers behind the house, tea will be ready soon. You must be hungry too. I'm putting my legs on the bike. Especially Ende, who said that she kept holding her head. Mine is missing again somehow. I'd say you're very happy. And now we can ride and ride. Wonderful afternoon. Wonderful afternoon. Yes, I must say, Mr. Dunsen. I hope you ate well. I did. There's just been a bit too much fussing. Time for a nice cup of office tea. Oh dear. Yes. Miss Peter, I must go away for a few days, please. I'm sure the Minister will manage without me until the end. We'll have the car brought forward, please, Miss Peter. Yes, I'm Johnson. I must go away for a few days, please. I'm sure the Minister will manage without me until the end. We'll have the car brought forward, please, Miss Peter. Thank you. I thought we'd all go to the island tomorrow. And have lunch with Uncle Quentin. Where's Jordina's Aunt Fennel? We've been so looking forward to seeing her. Which isn't the case. Well, George always disappears when she shouldn't. But what does she call George? She wants it that way. But everyone thinks she's a boy, not a girl. Apparently she doesn't want it any other way. Well, I don't want people to think I'm a boy. No, of course not. But you're not like George. Oh, it's nice to see you sometimes. We've eaten almost everything. I'm not hungry, thank you mother. Don't you want to say hello? This is End, Dick and Julian. Hello. Day. Hello. Hello. Why don't you go out with them, George? And show them around the area a bit. But I still have to. Yes, what? What do you have to do? Nothing. Then it's very good. Off you go. I cleared the table. Thank you for that, Auntie, Fennel. The place I lived in was a lot of fun too, children. Listen. Don't be late. No, no. Auntie, Fennel said we were on Wangel, you can go to the island. You don't have to do that, George. My name is not George. My name is George. And the island doesn't belong to him, it belongs to me. What are you getting so worked up about? It belongs to me. He gave it to me. And now you work there and don't let me go there at all. But if his work is a big secret, why do you do it in a place where anyone can go if they want to? You can try it, the cliffs off the island will turn your boat to pieces. Only Father and I know how to get through. He's there because he needs the tides for his experiments. That's why he's on my island. Well, I think it's great to be on my own island. Listen. I've got something to do now. It's just me, what do you mean. So, come on, we're just sneaking after her. None of you. We've got something, something to do. What fun can he have with you? It's not that bad, but I have to share a room with her. I tell you, it'll be two damn days. For us. Can I get him another one? Why not, if he can pay? Oh, we're more excited. Please? Thank you. Jimmy! Jimmy! And come on, Jimmy, come on, come on, come on! Come on, my little eight. That's Quentin Kirin's little one, isn't it? Yes. What's Wielder like as a boy? And most people here say just George to her health. Health. And that's her dog. The professor didn't want the dog in the house. She's supposed to show the way, but she's more attached to the dog than a man. Quentin is the sergeant now. I haven't seen him for a long time. Ah, he's withdrawn almost completely to the island, experimenting. Then he doesn't come over at all. His wife brings everything he needs over to the island. First he has to signal to me that everything is OK. Then he flashes his handkerchief three times from the tour. Every morning and every evening at 11. After that they can go to their places. Everyone has their quirks. Isn't it crazy to work so much? Come on! Come on, every rock! If George could go and not turn stupid straight away. Just tell George to come here. And finally, I have to pay for the ice cream tomorrow. You only say that because I'm such a couch potato. It looks very lonely. Hey, look! It looks like a big cave. Come here. There's not much to see there. Come on, let's go in deeper. We can't go in without a pocket. OK, let's go back and get one. We don't have time for that. Do you know what we'll examine again tomorrow, then? Of course, she's not going to run away from us. Just wait. But we'll keep it to ourselves. George has a secret here and this cave is only our secret. OK? OK. Oh, hello, children. You're visiting Karen Kattetsch, aren't you? Yes, that's right. Didn't George come with you? No. Oh yes, Uncle and Euretantes are good friends of mine. I didn't want to have tea with her tomorrow. Well, I don't know yet what we're going to do tomorrow. Well, it doesn't matter to him, composer starts. I want to be happy. See you again. Strange Kauts. That's just about strange people to me. Are you Fanny's the only normal person I've met here so far? Uncle, Quentin seems a bit strange to you too. Yes, we will find out tomorrow, to the island, right? Yes, whether I row, George? No, the Gl\u00f6ben feels okay, but leave there. Next! NYJ pressuresf\u65f6ruh collaborations What is Woman, Giyet remains in\ufffd\ufffd Oster. Federt etc. Wy - \u0441\u0447el and Vienna We are the Warrior These are grills sandwiches deep rockzdrehen. Excuse me. Deriesz with a little Bombang, George will take the boys and see if you can find him. Okay, come on! I wanted to eat them. Father! Father! No, I've never seen anything like that before? Look through that! Tell me, George, do you know what those things are up there on the clay? I would imagine that it has something to do with solar energy. The reflectors or again signs may be different. Father! Father! You're probably not up there. It has to be somewhere. Here I am! Professor K\u00f6rin, your island seems to be attracting quite a bit of attention. You've grown since the last time. That was eight years ago, wasn't it? Oh really? Then it was to be expected, or what do you think? Where are you hanging out on the island at the moment? In the cellars. Under the ruins, the cellars of the old castle. Tell me, is that your secret hole? Yes, you can call it that if you like. Can we look after yourselves properly, George? She rowed us out, around the dangerous cliffs. Wow, she can row. That means a boy, right? Well, now I have to go back. I still have something to check. Thanks for the supplies. George, you can have your island back soon. I'm as good as finished. And who's going to signal me? I'm doing myself anyway. No, I'm thinking about it. Do you still have it? See you again then. Well, Siegelsen! You there, you there! A lovely surprise, to be able to see you again. Chances! I assume you observe rare water birds, don't you? What an excellent telescope. Yes, that is an excellent telescope. Oh, tell me who are you working for this time? Russia, China, America? The last time we spoke, you were very unpleasant to us. I hope you realize that. You, I don't work for anyone, I give you my word. Your word. Oh, if that isn't a radio, I want to drop dead right now. That's enough. Put your little ones in. There, you wear that. There, sick children. George, what are you doing this afternoon? What's up with me? I was just thinking about who we'd found interesting. What? That's our secret. How are you in the hill at the end of the beach? You can think about it again. What we've found there is really something great. George, come on! Shorten, are you there? What's going on with him? But I've been getting more information from you every week. I don't understand why you're doing business with me again. Hello, Karne. Here you go, it's nice to hear your voice. I have the feeling that your activity has entered an unpleasant stadium for you, my enraged one. Bad luck for you. And one more thing, by the way. You will no longer be able to receive Mr. K\u00f6rten on that frequency. Come on. We are well aware that you will be in for trouble. First of all, we will both have a thorough talk. I don't think anyone has been here for a long time. You can't even see the end. It must go in incredibly far. Come on. This is not a cave. This is a tunnel that someone else built. It is incredibly long. It goes on here until it stops. What is that? That's a dog. Hey, who are you? If it belongs somewhere. I don't know, maybe the walls on the beach. Jimmy, Jimmy, where are you? That's ridiculous. I'm not hearing correctly. So that's a great secret now. Come on. Jimmy, how many times have I told you not to chase rabbits? Please look at me when I say something. Don't do anything to yourself, you strange dog. You are a very bad one. Come on now. Do I have to tell you everything a thousand times? Hello, George. Dick. So what is it, Jimmy? How do you know his name? You just called him. He told us a big fright. He's really sweet, George, was he yours? Yes. And why haven't we seen him in the house yet? Father has forbidden me to keep him, but a young man in the village is looking after him for me. I'd rather starve than have that get in the way. And besides, I can't live without him. Oh, now I understand, that's why you're skipping so much. But you don't need to be afraid. We won't tell you your secret. Certainly not George. He promises me. Yes, we promise. We like you just as much as you do. Friends? Friends. I didn't like the fact that we were friends anyway. What I wanted to tell you, George. The tunnel we found isn't a normal tunnel. We didn't get very far, but we found some steps. Yes, they lead straight into the earth. And one way out to the sea. Are you coming with me? Of course, come. Hello, children. Well, what about my invitation? We'd better go before you ask us to look down here. Yes, I'm hungry anyway. Okay, here we come. Come in, make yourselves comfortable. This is yours. Sorry, it's a bit untidy. Hint, look at the telescope. Oh yes, that's my hobby. I watch birds. Karin Island. Oh, I can see unlit storms quite clearly. A kind of evening, office corax. Rare shorebirds, I spotted a few of them on the island. Yes, and of course I saw you too. So, how's your father? My father here too. He's almost finished, he said. Ah, is that there? Yes. Good old Quentin. Well. Perhaps it could be thick in the raised table. There's some cake and biscuits in there. I'll make the tea in the meantime. Not up there. You'll find everything in the underride drawer, my boy. Oh, sorry. Oh, my goodness. The aunt. I mean, my aunt, Aunt John. She's coming for tea. Have you forgotten? You know her, I'm sure. Oh yes, of course, yes. Tame is really lovely. I've sent him a message straight away. I'm sorry. Goodbye and thank you very much. I'll look, though. It's really our fault. Excuse me. Thank you very much anyway. Goodbye. Well, maybe another time then. Who's Aunt John? We haven't got any Aunt Johns at all. Of course not, but he said he knew her anyway. He's just pretending to be a friend of Father's. But I never thought of Karl. You shouldn't have told him Father was nearly finished. You know very well that's a secret. I'm sorry, Jot. I thought of that. Don't you think you're exaggerating a bit, Jot? No, I think she's right. You certainly didn't see what was in the cupboard. There was a radio, quite a big one... Oh man. Really excellent, K\u00f6rten. And yes, I'm sorry, I... you left so suddenly. I couldn't ask any questions at all. I heard everything I wanted to know. So Professor Kirin is, as the boy said, almost finished. Don't be too stubborn, K\u00f6rten. You still have a lot of foreskins to go. Yes, maybe. Still, I think we're worrying too much. As long as Unquend still signals on time. It's about 11. Oh, that's flying very quickly. That's flying over the island. Have you seen his signal yet, children? No, not yet. Should be here any minute. Get rid of Father. There. One. Two. Three. Everything's OK, George. Nothing's wrong. Everything's OK, Kantifenni. Good. Now off you go. Go, go. I'm relieved, though. But tomorrow morning I'll eat now, watch the tower with a driving glass. Good night. Good night. Night. Night. Night. Ah. Professor Kirin, that is. Who the hell are you? I hardly think I know myself. My name is Johnson. I am from the Ministry of Research. Thank God, Mr. Johnson. At first I believed that you teach what we say. That is not true at the Ministry of Research. Because recently I decided to set up my own ministry too. Do you understand? And this is the beginning, Professor. The best that I can think of. Here on Kirin Island. What lies behind forbidden doors? We know no turning back. It will be discovered before us. We do not accept favors. We can stand up again. And friends, that is who we are. To her Digpo-N, Johnson, Tell me her Hoh. And friends, that is who we are. We will get there faster. And always her word. We will get there faster. And we are already there. We are there. And always her word. We will get there faster. And we are already there. We are there."

She said she'd never turn on me, you're alive and lame. What you did, what you did, you're alive and lame. All this fame you said I'd never feel like I'm lame. But I do, but I do do do do. Yeah, I go. Oh, little part of time. Don't worry about time. I'll turn it up. Oh, my dog. I'm never. Oh, my dog. Oh, my dog. I'm never. Oh, my dog. Stop with my bad, your big brother. I'm never. Oh, my dog. Oh, my dog. Oh, my dog. Oh, my dog. Oh, my dog. Oh, my dog. Oh, my dog. Oh, my dog. Oh, my dog. I'm gonna shock him, bless, to make a hold of that, large. What you got done to him, your dear ways of fugitive name, Billy Lucas, murder weapons bagged and tagged, and you shoot him, standing there next to my cruise. Huh. All I got to name, Herica Rockler. He called it in and waited. But she did pull the trigger. But she said, I'll put a name on the air, I guess we've been for price. Thanks, Dunning. Slim, though. We got this. Thanks, fellas. So, uh, this rock, my intersective Williams, is my partner in Detective Torres. You wanna tell us what happened? I do Q&A at your precinct. My attorney present. I think said this, if you continue, we'll be violating my rights. I'm gonna get it consumed, huh? I'll watch a lot of TV. All right, I'm gonna be doing killing people. Is that a question to Williams? Not even close. Hey Natasha, who are you? We're here in the cornstead. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You did? That's the minute truck. I'm sure you can come down, pick it up any time you need. No, that would be no trouble, baby. I'll see you then. Oh, bye. Woo! Yo, hey. She left her glasses and this truck, I, she's gonna come to pick them up. Well, she left was a big fat hen. Come on, man, what are you slipping now or something? You don't want it? Get it? Part B. Lieutenant, we got our purpose. Her name is Erica Rock, where she admitted to it, and we got the weapon. And? It's an easy-close door. I don't know, gentlemen. What about motive? Come on, we don't need that. We can statement her signature and these have done. Oh, just like that. Meanwhile, I heard that the Ben-Fuara went out on Billy Lucas two weeks ago, federal case, mixed bag of charges, counter-fitting through attempted murder. What's her role in this? Where does she fit in? What's her background? Well, she's not talking until the lawyer so is on. But all we got on her right now is that she's from North Carolina, and she got three prior for being neat and again charged. And does she do any time? No, they would drop. All right, well, you see, we might have some blanks to fill in here, gentlemen. Why don't we do that? And then we can wrap it up. All right? Yeah. All right, well, well, well. What do we got here? On my other Jordan, you dropped this New York attorney. She's ready to cooperate fully. OK, I'll buy first. New York attorney. What do you got one in every state now? Not yet. But if business picks up, I'll need more. What is this business that you do? Fugitive Retrieval. That almost sounds professional, huh? Well, let's be real. You're nothing but a damn bounty, honey. When the bill jumped a turn nasty, I had to take him down. It was him or me. Do I have stupid retina on my face? You expect me to buy that? No, you just don't like it. Well, that too. You see, you bounty hunters are not professionals. You don't even know what the hell you're doing up here. You're out of line, detective. My client came into town yesterday. She had certified copies of a bail agreement. She came in and she checked in with a desk sergeant downstairs. She went by the book. There is no book. That is the problem. So what really happened, Erica? He spooked you and then what? Boom, you have to shoot him. Is that what happened? I don't spook easily. And I don't get paid on corpses. Look, he took my gun. He had me on the ground. He was going to fire. I had no choice. Right, right. So how were you able to track him down so fast? Criminals are creatures of habit. Lucas had a thing for a hookah. So I just passed some cash around and waited for a never. So who ratted him out? I washed out Skink on time, square. She must have sold me out because a clown who I was coming. What's her name? Crystal. Crystal what? Shem Belair, how the hell am I supposed to know? She's a hookah. For a price you'll be any name you wanted to be. Enough of that. You make a decision. If you charge my client, we'll cut a loose. Yeah, well, that's it, gentlemen. Check the desk sergeancy if your story holds up. Lieutenant. Not what, Williams. Whether you like it or not, bounty hunting's illegal occupation. They are dangerous amateurs, Lieutenant. What about the people's rights? You just don't have any rights. They hand them over to the Bill Bond'sman who in turn gets it to the bounty hunter. Look, a man is dead. Now, he may have been a criminal, but she's the one that took his life. Yes, which only goes to support the argument that things went bad towards the end, Torres. Now, she had a lot to gain by bringing Lucas in alive. The hell of a way to make a living. What do we do now? Well, we make sure that CSU and the coroner agree on track. The coroner agree on trajectory load and buckshut spray. We cross every T dot every I. Sorry, I'm late. Don't sweat it, you covered. Cooper asked for me. She did indeed. What's your teller? You mail problems? What? It covers the myriad of elves. This way nobody asks me Jack. So where were you when you went? My attorneys. Anything wrong? I was catching. Your turn, I got the last one. Morena, fourth squad. Yep. Okay, you'll be right there. I got a shooting, Tommy. It's a car. It's nice surface. All right. Any of you not here as part of the investigation leave now. You're destroying the claim scene. How about I take the body? Offside on it you? Yeah. You need a few minutes or can you do this? No, no, look, the quick of the better. Now, how soon before the wagon gets here? I don't want to since wife seen it like this. It should be a soon. So what happened? We worked a late tour. We dropped them off as usual. I go home to crash. Camille, that's his wife. She calls me from her job. She's hysterical, and a panic. What about... She says they're talking on the phone and... Something he yells at somebody and then the phone went dead. She kept calling back but there was no answer. That's when you came over to check it out? Yeah, right. And I get here and... Take your time. The door was open and the mess and everything. It's a great time. Single shot to the head, close range. There was powder burns around the wound. I checked his pulse. I used my cell to call it in. It's been touched. Was there anything missing? It's gone. I don't know what else. We're going to have to ask Camille. I'm not. Yeah, what you got? Take a little... Okay, while there are any pictures, all angles right here. Hey! Hello? The motor live. And hello to you too. Have a seat. Are you looking good, girl? Is this what you need? Yeah. I'm always leaving those some. Hey, I'm a man. I hate to say this. Looks like old girl was right. Yeah. Ah, Natasha. This is my point of Eddie Torres. Oh, this is my French teacher. Oh, man. Right. You know what? I got a fun fight. Nice to meet you. My man. Joe, anyway, home. I just make a break. I'm outta here, Williams. What'd you do? Me? Nothing. Don't let him break you, honey. He's not gonna straighten no time. Didn't they tell you that you can go? So why don't you go? I'm after Lucas's pal, Kevin Swain. What did you do to know? Just in case. Who is that? Some... A trouble. Well, I'm gonna let you get back to work. All right, listen. What we should do, I don't know. What I think we should do, I mean, you should meet tonight. You'll have dinner with Snife Blame. Hello, Alex. Can you come? I'm gonna see they lock you up, Rock. Even if I have to do it myself. Nobody's calling me that long time. You murdered Billy Lucas. Oh, man. Listen, I'm warning you. Stay away from Kevin Swain. He's mine. Unless he's in shackles, he's up for a rant. No, not this time. We go way back, you, man. I don't wanna see you get hurt. I touched. Really? I'm gonna see you. I'm gonna see you. I'm gonna see you. I touched. Really? You think the fight is not too difficult? It was to detect his working on the case. Alex Pratt, Deputy US Marshal. How's it going? So what's this all about? Ericka Rockler. Lieutenant was telling me that so far this looks clean? What are you saying that it's not? I know it's not. Rock used to be one of us. She worked for the government. She was a Marshal. She was a good one too. Till she lost a witness in a treasury case. The two men suspected of orchestrating that particular horror show. Who Billy Lucas. And Kevin Swain. So you think that it's revenge? Absolutely. She lost her witness and her career. Not revenge. I'd say that's mild. Yes, sir. Alrighty, down. The feds say they're gonna send over that file on Kevin Swain as soon as possible. Which means never you got it. So BCI says the man's got 14 priors for four drinks. Buying a set of $2 million and like Lucas, a warrant with issue two weeks ago. Ericka bags him that's 200 G's in her pocket. That's a big payday. She's got a score to settle with this Lucas guy. Yeah, but we don't have any evidence to support America. Moadeth Ed. She lied to us. Five hundred. When we stopped with her snatch, Erica says that she sent her up, so maybe she want to ask why. Alright, we got a girl by the name of Crystal Wade, 110th and Pleasant. Where have you been? I know. You're hurting me. Where's Lucas? We have a meet in two hours. Yeah, Ed. What? What's that? Some bitch came sniffing around looking for both of you. So I called Lucas and told them about it. Shut up. No, I didn't. I swear I didn't. He told me to pay her and get her to come to the club. I just did what he said. I swear I didn't. I didn't. I wish she... Name's Erica. The cops locked her up. Where are you going? Shut up. What does that mean? I'm going with you. No, not. Yes, I am. Don't make this hardest wave. You won't survive. Ah! Shoot. You killed her. Whatever. But you, I need life. Hey, hold it, you! Back up! Club it! Put it down. He's mine. Mrs. Vincent. I'm sorry about your loss. Camille used to detect it so it'd be work in the case. I'm going to find a bastard. No, you're on the phone when this happened. Is that right? He always called me when he worked nights. I know he was all right. And what did you hear? A crash. Like something broke. Then Todd yelled and the phone went dead. Do you remember what he yelled? Okay. That's it? Would your husband suffer from depression? What difference does that make? We're just covering all the bases, Tony. You should know that. Man, was he having problems on the job? No. This is my husband. It's not unhappy. And he was not crazy. Does someone killed him or don't you care? Nice technique, Dennis. It's a hell of a way to treat one of you. You're off for the books, kid. How's that? Ben's worn a body for two mil. Uncle Sam must want you bad. I want to make a call. I'm entitled to a call. That's my right. Sure, no problem. I mean, as soon as we processed these other charges, murder, fake money, I mean, that pretty much guarantees you life. What do you want? Where'd you get the money? What do I get? I'm going to see the court, Anna. It's my own life, I guess. Sweeten the deal, I'll lead you right to him. Meet him on our riverside on the past. Me with whom? Deal first. No, you're in no position to bargain, baby. Well, maybe you should look at these senotes again, baby. They're supposed to be counterfeit proof. Tell you what. Why don't you call the feds. But they make a deal. We'll say. So tell you anything we can swing this? I'm going to talk to the state's attorney and see what we have to offer. Don't do this, Lieutenant. It's a mistake. You can't play federal games with local talent. Your opinion doesn't count. And I'm doing you a favor by even allowing you in here, Ms. Rocklar. Lieutenant, please. Let me take him in, just to consort out the rest. Now, what you really want? You pal' Pratt and the feds tell a difference. I knew Alex Pratt would fill you in. He used you. Oh, really? How? I don't know. He's a man in a lot of ways. He's a man of a way. See, my motive is strictly money. His is prestige. He brings Swain in first. Hell, even Janorena would have to take notice. Let me take him in. I have to surrender him to the sheriff to collect my fee. Sorry, this is going to go down our way. Set her up, Williams. This man. This Narikah. I'm so okay, Lam's. I already know how to bend over. Where are you going? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? I heard you legal battle. That's escalated. Yeah, that's why I'm here. My buyer's real interested in your place. Of course. Come on, you're not going to try to jack the price up on me, guys. Yeah, I'm going to get the price up on you. You know, I'm going to get the price up on you. You're going to get the price up on you. I'm going to get the price on you. Come on, you're not going to try to jack the price up on me, guys. Kevin, the free market is not for neophytes. When you're in trouble, you need to steal. I don't. When this bait says something concrete, he's going to want. Yeah, but you know, he's going to be careful. You've got to get out of town. I'll let you know. Company. Damn, he made us. Let's go. What's the hell you doing? Get my money. Let's go. Move it now. Give me two nights. I'm going to get the price up on you. Go. Go. Come on. What the hell you doing? Get my money. Let's go. Move it now. Give me two nights. Shoot. Perfect. Run. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. You want to see this? Back off, gentlemen. It's just federal. It's waiting, man. He is protecting witness. Look at that. It's right here. What the hell are you doing? My job. It's right here. It's right here. It's going on. There you go. Two years work down the drain because your detectives couldn't master surveillance 101. Watch how you talk about my men, Pratt, all right? And you're in no position to throw stones because you didn't even tell me that there was a federal operation going on in my jurisdiction. I don't have a question, my call. I protect the witness. That's it. You have son of a bitch, Alex. Kenneth Swain murdered a witness under our protection and you gave that low-life snitch a deal. You have no evidence to prove that and, frankly, Rock, if you remember, there is nothing more important than the national interest. You already lost your star over this, let it go. I need some air. Ah, yeah. Look, I don't like this anymore than you do. But the fact is, we need bait to get Russell baits at money. It's the streets we won't recover for years. Yeah, right. So you're saying this promotion that you get for bringing a man is just gravy, right? Fairly the soapbox detective. You're willing to make a deal with Swain to get a bait yourself. I was ready to send him to jail. Not to some beach with a new idea and a pocket full of money. Most criminals went to the program due time first. He's not going to do a day in time if it's up to you. I mean, besides, we've got solid proof against your boyfriend murder. A man can't stand trial if he no longer exists. Lou, come on. Oh, please. Let it go, Taurus. We should have processed him while we had him. Possessions 9-10 for the war. Hey, Matt. The, um, the parent and child son officer Vincent came back and conclusive. CSUs that they were too many astringent chemicals present. Like what? The beach would do it. From dust your strength cleaners. It's suspicious enough that he's an antelope. No, well, not if he just came out of the shower. I was washing dishes. All right. Thanks. Thank you. It's gonna be all right. Is Detective Williams here? He'll be down in a sec. Park it. So, would you do this time? I gave it a damn. I knew the system wasn't perfect, but I thought it worked. You're a cop? Not anymore. I don't want to end up a drunk or a plane with my gun in the dark. Sorry. You don't waste that on me. You save that for the poor slugs like Williams. They need your pity. I haven't known JC very long, but he does not seem like the kind of man anyone should feel sorry for. Not yet, but it's coming. He's got that cop disease. Look, I don't know what you're talking about, but if JC wants to tell me something, I prefer he told me on his own. Hmm. Then you're in for a long wait. You see cops don't talk to anybody else but cops, wives and girlfriends. They don't know Jack until they come home and there's brains about it all over the wall. You're exaggerating. What do you say? Look, the job comes first. Cancel dates, unanswered questions, mood swings, and if you have kids with cops, you can count on raising them your own damn self. There's one thing I know about JC, is that he takes a big part in raising his son. Well, have you ever talked to the boys and mother? I'm sure she might sing a different tone. You obviously don't know him. I know him better than you do and I just met him. Give JC a message for me. Tell him not to let it get to me. Not let what gets to me. If he wants you to know, he'll tell you. All right. Something wrong? Hey, yeah, I'm sorry. I meant to call you. I just... That's okay. Don't worry about it. What happened? Just this case I'm working on. You know, the whole thing went bust. It's even a bad taste in my mouth. Well, I'm a good listener if you want somebody to talk to. Oh, thanks. Okay. Well, tell me later. Well, do. Oh, yeah, that girl that was here earlier. Where? Yeah. She told me to tell you don't let it get to you. She said that, huh? Yeah, she's wanting to talk. Did she say where she was going? Sorry. We'll go. See you later. Listen, this one shouldn't know I really did want to see you tonight. Yeah, me too. All right. So, how do you want to handle this time? We're going to close this case and soon. Oh, it's a suicide. Donnie, you tried to cover for his partner. It took his gun from the scene. And we go for a warrant. Every cop on the squire is going to be out on his life. No, he'll be stupid to keep it anyway. The wife, the wife, the weak link. We get her alone itself. I wish we were going to do this. It means Donnie his career. It means wife's pension. I don't know what I'm supposed to think of, Phil. Well, I know this. Just because he pulled a trigger doesn't mean the job didn't kill him. Oh, no, no, no. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Oh, yeah. That's the two things. Yeah. You know how loving up on life is best of way. You know how loving tonight is a warm thing. You know how loving. May I help you? You know? Yeah. Come here. So I thought you were going to North Carolina. I don't like the country. So, so why do you live there then? I just sheep. She looks like women. Why do you live there? It's too much. I just don't know. You know, I do. She's like, hmm. What are you looking for, Williams? You have no business poking around in my fight. Crack gave this to me, OK? What does he have against you anyway? I was his partner. And I never told him that our witness had contact with the relative. I lost my job, and Alex lost a promotion. So is that the reason why your witness was killed? Oh, yeah. He loved his wife, and they knew it. She refused to go into the program. You can't say that a blamer. All you get for your civic duty is a new birth certificate in $1,200 a month or a year and a half. So why did he come forward? Because he was a damn fool who didn't know. He witnessed a murder. He mined your own business. You don't make a description. You don't think of the bastards in line up. You don't give up your life because it's the right thing to do. I don't think so. OK. Oh, come on. It's OK. It'll be nice to me when. OK, you don't need to cry, all right? Let's go get some rest. All right? OK. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. What's it called nothing? I can't breathe. Don't you want nothing? Oh, I'm afraid. Oh, yeah. Oh, don't let go. You have my room. Yeah. Oh, don't let go. I didn't tell myself that we could be more than this friend. I know you think that when we'll do it, would all end up in a different way. You know when we'd do it. Okay. Come on. Show us the character now. OK. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh, please. Do come on. Got everything? Come on. I don't want to break up. Hi. You have to, oh, this is embarrassing. I've never used justice to a advocacy yourself towards that organization. She is shooting you up. There, I have it. Now that u got to chat up, why didn't she grandma say you were going? What's up... Don't you want something? Don't you want to go, and pray? Do we have to go?

What's up? Swinging to deputy marshals were ambushed Pracks on my ass and the feds are trying to take over my priest and other than that, Williamson's quiet Did you say ambushed? When? I've seen her because description was seen at the hotel I want to know what points out on her and I want this mess cleared up before the breast or a human being It wasn't her Williamson, I know how you feel She's been through it and then some, but now it's out of my hands No, no tenant, I know that it wasn't her Because she was with me last What's yours with you? Yeah, she was with me Where is she now? She's at the hotel Don't get it towards us What? What? I told you everything that I knew You yelled, hey, you know we got that Now, there wasn't much missing from your place Maybe they got scared when I shut my husband Why was Officer Vincent seeing a police drink? I thought that was confidential It is That's why I'm asking I don't know You didn't ask? He said it was for the job For the job or because of it She cops lose it all the time Need to get it off their chest, we cheat on our spouses We drink, even eat our guns We got her saying around the squad If you can get two shots off before the end, you're real hard-ass He didn't kill himself Then how did he get powder burns on his hand? We have a test for that Camille We checked his reports he hadn't fight his weapon in weeks And it was broken glass outside the window But the perks broke in The glass would have been on the floor We're not stupid He said you wouldn't know He said you wouldn't know He said you wouldn't know He said you wouldn't know What time did you need the precinct? After everything has happened, you can't believe that I did this But you didn't pull the trigger because the detective William said you were together Then why am I? Because you went to the regional town He swam was being held there before being moved to a safe house And somehow, you're pretty the last found that out I wasn't here There was a lot of people who were in the hospital They were in the hospital You're pretty the last found that out I wasn't here Yes you were, because somebody I did your photo If I was with Williams, how do you explain it? Revenge Change, record. This was a little tired You know, you're not the only one with a girl, Jerica As of yesterday, Russell B. William, get back here Prove it Oh, I will. And I can't And I got this I got it I guess I know how you feel, huh? A trade used Then you get angry, right? And payback is the only thing that you can think about until she becomes a bitch all of a sudden It's about right, isn't it? I mean, you played me well, girl I mean, who else better than vouchers on a cup? It wasn't like that But this time I'll play you, right? Now you're right We can improve it. You're going to have to cooperate And trust me when I tell you, you will when I'm done with you I'm out of here You should share this right here Now you went to bait, you told him where to find Swain You told him how the marsh was operating He ends up dead So whether or not you gave it to him for free Or you sold it to him, you did it, we know it And you're going to pay for that How will you? You're going to go to baits Just like you did And I'm going to tell him we got you on two counts of conspiracy to murder US deputy marshals and one Kevin Swain Then I'm going to tell him It's just a matter of time before you serve him up to us on a plate Who thank you, Paul String? I will, Willie And you're willing to take that risk I don't believe you It's not just that Come talk to us T know! Damn Right Good about to make sure you cover my ass. You're a protected witness, whether I like it or not. I told you before, we'll do anything to get Bates even to give you a deal. Listen, the first is wired in the lining. The page where it's backup. Now, the range isn't good or not the one, so we're going to have to be close. Just get Bates to say something and premonating, and then we'll come in. I know what you mean. Williams. Come on, have a minute. I never meant to hurt you. I just couldn't let Swayne get away again. Let me ask you something. If you get away with doing the same thing, then what makes you different than him? Look, I couldn't take the national interest anymore. The smitches and the finks, double dipping between federal agencies. There's been a $100 million. The smitches last year. The smite was the last straw. That's very noble, Erica. What you read a book. The reason why I chose you is because I knew you wouldn't need me twisting in the wind. Most cops, they would have never opened their mouths about us. It was not my morals that I questioned. It was my taste. Move your hands a little to the left. I might get something out of this, too. Just clean. For a woman, you travel very late. Make up's in the car. You want it? Some men appreciate a shop, waiting to female. I'm not going to be able to do that. Some men appreciate a shop, waiting to female. I'm not one of them. When we talked yesterday, you didn't seem to mind. I don't know what you're talking about. I gave you a freebie. You said butchers instead of somebody subtle. So I'll get to the point. I got cops asking me questions. I don't like it. It's not because some of them are fidgety. They haven't said a damn thing we can use. I could give you a loan to help you. Straighten out your problems. Unfortunately, don't keep any cash. Come on, do something, rock. How much we talking here? I gave you swans whereabouts. Two marshals got killed. How much you need? Enough to get lost. Fair enough. Call my associate. He'll take care of you. You know what she's doing? You're proud. Your witness is leaving. She left one of the transmitters in the office. We have to stay in range. How is it going? So where we going anyway? You know what? I know this city like the back of my hand. You take half done, you're going to hit traffic. Then we should turn off this street. I wish we'd just stayed there. I'd lost you earlier, static. Okay, I got a little help. Don't worry, Clark. Yes, sir. I understand. Okay. Don't take this person like the one who likes people sitting behind me. If you could just leave her alone. I wish they'd show her. Where is he? Come on, is there anything coming through? Yeah. What's it? I want his phone plate. enterprise for you, Nick. And he's coming, identify. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Hey, fucker! Get out of there! Get out of there! Get out of there! I want an answer! Get out of there! Get in there! What the hell is she doing? Hear me talking to you! Hey, see! Get out of there! Oh, that's my... You're done now. Sit down, Don, if you, unless you want to tell your story to one police plaza. What difference does it make who I talk to? The girls in the report that you staged this whole thing, the brass won't be satisfied with just your resignation. Did Officer Vincent take his own life? Maybe you forgot what it's like out there on the street. And hell, you gold shields don't show up till the smoke's cleared anyway. You're still gonna have to... I believe in you. You don't see some guy beating the crap out of his wife? I want some kid, but her brain's out. And you never find out why. So, Eats has gotten lady to clean up his mess? He was my partner. What's this? Officer Todd Vincent died from a gunshot wound fired by an unknown assailant. Hey, Bonjour. If you're looking for Jeanne, he went that way with Nikki. No, I thought I'd come see you and say hello. Hello. So, um, how have you been? I've been all right. Haven't seen you around in a while. Yeah, um, you know that woman who's worked on that case? Yeah, Erika. Well, she was killed. J.C., I'm so sorry. I had me, too. So, I needed to, you know, just take time away. I know we didn't get off to the best start. So, what I want to try to do is make it up to you. I don't think that'll be a good idea. Why not? J.C., I don't always know what I want, but I know what I don't want. What's this? It's a second place. Not over a woman, not over a job, nothing. Who's talking about second place? And then, you know, people settle. And that's not me. So... Prince? I'm Rosanna Scotto coming up next for the second time this week, a serious accident at a New York airport. We'll go inside the home of the cult of death. New details on how they took their own lives. Plus, their eerie final message. Why were they so concerned about a comet in some UFOs? Also, a head by by Hyves Control Fee, the judge tells OJ to pay up. There's a videotape that might help police find notorious BIG's killer. You'd better make sure you pay all your tickets when you see this woman coming with her computer or else. Why Charles Manson doesn't want to be free. And Martin Luther King Jr's son goes face to face with James Earl Ray. Put down that remote, the 10 o'clock news is next. Welcome to my world. Come on this fast, you stay.",

She said she'd never turn on me, you're alive and lame. What you did, what you did, you're alive and lame. All this fame you said I'd never feel like I'm lame. But I do, but I do do do do. Yeah, I go. Oh, little part of time. Don't worry about time. I'll turn it up. Oh, my dog. I'm never. Oh, my dog. Oh, my dog. I'm never. Oh, my dog. Stop with my bad, your big brother. I'm never. Oh, my dog. Oh, my dog. Oh, my dog. Oh, my dog. Oh, my dog. Oh, my dog. Oh, my dog. Oh, my dog. Oh, my dog. I'm gonna shock him, bless, to make a hold of that, large. What you got done to him, your dear ways of fugitive name, Billy Lucas, murder weapons bagged and tagged, and you shoot him, standing there next to my cruise. Huh. All I got to name, Herica Rockler. He called it in and waited. But she did pull the trigger. But she said, I'll put a name on the air, I guess we've been for price. Thanks, Dunning. Slim, though. We got this. Thanks, fellas. So, uh, this rock, my intersective Williams, is my partner in Detective Torres. You wanna tell us what happened? I do Q&A at your precinct. My attorney present. I think said this, if you continue, we'll be violating my rights. I'm gonna get it consumed, huh? I'll watch a lot of TV. All right, I'm gonna be doing killing people. Is that a question to Williams? Not even close. Hey Natasha, who are you? We're here in the cornstead. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You did? That's the minute truck. I'm sure you can come down, pick it up any time you need. No, that would be no trouble, baby. I'll see you then. Oh, bye. Woo! Yo, hey. She left her glasses and this truck, I, she's gonna come to pick them up. Well, she left was a big fat hen. Come on, man, what are you slipping now or something? You don't want it? Get it? Part B. Lieutenant, we got our purpose. Her name is Erica Rock, where she admitted to it, and we got the weapon. And? It's an easy-close door. I don't know, gentlemen. What about motive? Come on, we don't need that. We can statement her signature and these have done. Oh, just like that. Meanwhile, I heard that the Ben-Fuara went out on Billy Lucas two weeks ago, federal case, mixed bag of charges, counter-fitting through attempted murder. What's her role in this? Where does she fit in? What's her background? Well, she's not talking until the lawyer so is on. But all we got on her right now is that she's from North Carolina, and she got three prior for being neat and again charged. And does she do any time? No, they would drop. All right, well, you see, we might have some blanks to fill in here, gentlemen. Why don't we do that? And then we can wrap it up. All right? Yeah. All right, well, well, well. What do we got here? On my other Jordan, you dropped this New York attorney. She's ready to cooperate fully. OK, I'll buy first. New York attorney. What do you got one in every state now? Not yet. But if business picks up, I'll need more. What is this business that you do? Fugitive Retrieval. That almost sounds professional, huh? Well, let's be real. You're nothing but a damn bounty, honey. When the bill jumped a turn nasty, I had to take him down. It was him or me. Do I have stupid retina on my face? You expect me to buy that? No, you just don't like it. Well, that too. You see, you bounty hunters are not professionals. You don't even know what the hell you're doing up here. You're out of line, detective. My client came into town yesterday. She had certified copies of a bail agreement. She came in and she checked in with a desk sergeant downstairs. She went by the book. There is no book. That is the problem. So what really happened, Erica? He spooked you and then what? Boom, you have to shoot him. Is that what happened? I don't spook easily. And I don't get paid on corpses. Look, he took my gun. He had me on the ground. He was going to fire. I had no choice. Right, right. So how were you able to track him down so fast? Criminals are creatures of habit. Lucas had a thing for a hookah. So I just passed some cash around and waited for a never. So who ratted him out? I washed out Skink on time, square. She must have sold me out because a clown who I was coming. What's her name? Crystal. Crystal what? Shem Belair, how the hell am I supposed to know? She's a hookah. For a price you'll be any name you wanted to be. Enough of that. You make a decision. If you charge my client, we'll cut a loose. Yeah, well, that's it, gentlemen. Check the desk sergeancy if your story holds up. Lieutenant. Not what, Williams. Whether you like it or not, bounty hunting's illegal occupation. They are dangerous amateurs, Lieutenant. What about the people's rights? You just don't have any rights. They hand them over to the Bill Bond'sman who in turn gets it to the bounty hunter. Look, a man is dead. Now, he may have been a criminal, but she's the one that took his life. Yes, which only goes to support the argument that things went bad towards the end, Torres. Now, she had a lot to gain by bringing Lucas in alive. The hell of a way to make a living. What do we do now? Well, we make sure that CSU and the coroner agree on track. The coroner agree on trajectory load and buckshut spray. We cross every T dot every I. Sorry, I'm late. Don't sweat it, you covered. Cooper asked for me. She did indeed. What's your teller? You mail problems? What? It covers the myriad of elves. This way nobody asks me Jack. So where were you when you went? My attorneys. Anything wrong? I was catching. Your turn, I got the last one. Morena, fourth squad. Yep. Okay, you'll be right there. I got a shooting, Tommy. It's a car. It's nice surface. All right. Any of you not here as part of the investigation leave now. You're destroying the claim scene. How about I take the body? Offside on it you? Yeah. You need a few minutes or can you do this? No, no, look, the quick of the better. Now, how soon before the wagon gets here? I don't want to since wife seen it like this. It should be a soon. So what happened? We worked a late tour. We dropped them off as usual. I go home to crash. Camille, that's his wife. She calls me from her job. She's hysterical, and a panic. What about... She says they're talking on the phone and... Something he yells at somebody and then the phone went dead. She kept calling back but there was no answer. That's when you came over to check it out? Yeah, right. And I get here and... Take your time. The door was open and the mess and everything. It's a great time. Single shot to the head, close range. There was powder burns around the wound. I checked his pulse. I used my cell to call it in. It's been touched. Was there anything missing? It's gone. I don't know what else. We're going to have to ask Camille. I'm not. Yeah, what you got? Take a little... Okay, while there are any pictures, all angles right here. Hey! Hello? The motor live. And hello to you too. Have a seat. Are you looking good, girl? Is this what you need? Yeah. I'm always leaving those some. Hey, I'm a man. I hate to say this. Looks like old girl was right. Yeah. Ah, Natasha. This is my point of Eddie Torres. Oh, this is my French teacher. Oh, man. Right. You know what? I got a fun fight. Nice to meet you. My man. Joe, anyway, home. I just make a break. I'm outta here, Williams. What'd you do? Me? Nothing. Don't let him break you, honey. He's not gonna straighten no time. Didn't they tell you that you can go? So why don't you go? I'm after Lucas's pal, Kevin Swain. What did you do to know? Just in case. Who is that? Some... A trouble. Well, I'm gonna let you get back to work. All right, listen. What we should do, I don't know. What I think we should do, I mean, you should meet tonight. You'll have dinner with Snife Blame. Hello, Alex. Can you come? I'm gonna see they lock you up, Rock. Even if I have to do it myself. Nobody's calling me that long time. You murdered Billy Lucas. Oh, man. Listen, I'm warning you. Stay away from Kevin Swain. He's mine. Unless he's in shackles, he's up for a rant. No, not this time. We go way back, you, man. I don't wanna see you get hurt. I touched. Really? I'm gonna see you. I'm gonna see you. I'm gonna see you. I touched. Really? You think the fight is not too difficult? It was to detect his working on the case. Alex Pratt, Deputy US Marshal. How's it going? So what's this all about? Ericka Rockler. Lieutenant was telling me that so far this looks clean? What are you saying that it's not? I know it's not. Rock used to be one of us. She worked for the government. She was a Marshal. She was a good one too. Till she lost a witness in a treasury case. The two men suspected of orchestrating that particular horror show. Who Billy Lucas. And Kevin Swain. So you think that it's revenge? Absolutely. She lost her witness and her career. Not revenge. I'd say that's mild. Yes, sir. Alrighty, down. The feds say they're gonna send over that file on Kevin Swain as soon as possible. Which means never you got it. So BCI says the man's got 14 priors for four drinks. Buying a set of $2 million and like Lucas, a warrant with issue two weeks ago. Ericka bags him that's 200 G's in her pocket. That's a big payday. She's got a score to settle with this Lucas guy. Yeah, but we don't have any evidence to support America. Moadeth Ed. She lied to us. Five hundred. When we stopped with her snatch, Erica says that she sent her up, so maybe she want to ask why. Alright, we got a girl by the name of Crystal Wade, 110th and Pleasant. Where have you been? I know. You're hurting me. Where's Lucas? We have a meet in two hours. Yeah, Ed. What? What's that? Some bitch came sniffing around looking for both of you. So I called Lucas and told them about it. Shut up. No, I didn't. I swear I didn't. He told me to pay her and get her to come to the club. I just did what he said. I swear I didn't. I didn't. I wish she... Name's Erica. The cops locked her up. Where are you going? Shut up. What does that mean? I'm going with you. No, not. Yes, I am. Don't make this hardest wave. You won't survive. Ah! Shoot. You killed her. Whatever. But you, I need life. Hey, hold it, you! Back up! Club it! Put it down. He's mine. Mrs. Vincent. I'm sorry about your loss. Camille used to detect it so it'd be work in the case. I'm going to find a bastard. No, you're on the phone when this happened. Is that right? He always called me when he worked nights. I know he was all right. And what did you hear? A crash. Like something broke. Then Todd yelled and the phone went dead. Do you remember what he yelled? Okay. That's it? Would your husband suffer from depression? What difference does that make? We're just covering all the bases, Tony. You should know that. Man, was he having problems on the job? No. This is my husband. It's not unhappy. And he was not crazy. Does someone killed him or don't you care? Nice technique, Dennis. It's a hell of a way to treat one of you. You're off for the books, kid. How's that? Ben's worn a body for two mil. Uncle Sam must want you bad. I want to make a call. I'm entitled to a call. That's my right. Sure, no problem. I mean, as soon as we processed these other charges, murder, fake money, I mean, that pretty much guarantees you life. What do you want? Where'd you get the money? What do I get? I'm going to see the court, Anna. It's my own life, I guess. Sweeten the deal, I'll lead you right to him. Meet him on our riverside on the past. Me with whom? Deal first. No, you're in no position to bargain, baby. Well, maybe you should look at these senotes again, baby. They're supposed to be counterfeit proof. Tell you what. Why don't you call the feds. But they make a deal. We'll say. So tell you anything we can swing this? I'm going to talk to the state's attorney and see what we have to offer. Don't do this, Lieutenant. It's a mistake. You can't play federal games with local talent. Your opinion doesn't count. And I'm doing you a favor by even allowing you in here, Ms. Rocklar. Lieutenant, please. Let me take him in, just to consort out the rest. Now, what you really want? You pal' Pratt and the feds tell a difference. I knew Alex Pratt would fill you in. He used you. Oh, really? How? I don't know. He's a man in a lot of ways. He's a man of a way. See, my motive is strictly money. His is prestige. He brings Swain in first. Hell, even Janorena would have to take notice. Let me take him in. I have to surrender him to the sheriff to collect my fee. Sorry, this is going to go down our way. Set her up, Williams. This man. This Narikah. I'm so okay, Lam's. I already know how to bend over. Where are you going? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? I heard you legal battle. That's escalated. Yeah, that's why I'm here. My buyer's real interested in your place. Of course. Come on, you're not going to try to jack the price up on me, guys. Yeah, I'm going to get the price up on you. You know, I'm going to get the price up on you. You're going to get the price up on you. I'm going to get the price on you. Come on, you're not going to try to jack the price up on me, guys. Kevin, the free market is not for neophytes. When you're in trouble, you need to steal. I don't. When this bait says something concrete, he's going to want. Yeah, but you know, he's going to be careful. You've got to get out of town. I'll let you know. Company. Damn, he made us. Let's go. What's the hell you doing? Get my money. Let's go. Move it now. Give me two nights. I'm going to get the price up on you. Go. Go. Come on. What the hell you doing? Get my money. Let's go. Move it now. Give me two nights. Shoot. Perfect. Run. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. You want to see this? Back off, gentlemen. It's just federal. It's waiting, man. He is protecting witness. Look at that. It's right here. What the hell are you doing? My job. It's right here. It's right here. It's going on. There you go. Two years work down the drain because your detectives couldn't master surveillance 101. Watch how you talk about my men, Pratt, all right? And you're in no position to throw stones because you didn't even tell me that there was a federal operation going on in my jurisdiction. I don't have a question, my call. I protect the witness. That's it. You have son of a bitch, Alex. Kenneth Swain murdered a witness under our protection and you gave that low-life snitch a deal. You have no evidence to prove that and, frankly, Rock, if you remember, there is nothing more important than the national interest. You already lost your star over this, let it go. I need some air. Ah, yeah. Look, I don't like this anymore than you do. But the fact is, we need bait to get Russell baits at money. It's the streets we won't recover for years. Yeah, right. So you're saying this promotion that you get for bringing a man is just gravy, right? Fairly the soapbox detective. You're willing to make a deal with Swain to get a bait yourself. I was ready to send him to jail. Not to some beach with a new idea and a pocket full of money. Most criminals went to the program due time first. He's not going to do a day in time if it's up to you. I mean, besides, we've got solid proof against your boyfriend murder. A man can't stand trial if he no longer exists. Lou, come on. Oh, please. Let it go, Taurus. We should have processed him while we had him. Possessions 9-10 for the war. Hey, Matt. The, um, the parent and child son officer Vincent came back and conclusive. CSUs that they were too many astringent chemicals present. Like what? The beach would do it. From dust your strength cleaners. It's suspicious enough that he's an antelope. No, well, not if he just came out of the shower. I was washing dishes. All right. Thanks. Thank you. It's gonna be all right. Is Detective Williams here? He'll be down in a sec. Park it. So, would you do this time? I gave it a damn. I knew the system wasn't perfect, but I thought it worked. You're a cop? Not anymore. I don't want to end up a drunk or a plane with my gun in the dark. Sorry. You don't waste that on me. You save that for the poor slugs like Williams. They need your pity. I haven't known JC very long, but he does not seem like the kind of man anyone should feel sorry for. Not yet, but it's coming. He's got that cop disease. Look, I don't know what you're talking about, but if JC wants to tell me something, I prefer he told me on his own. Hmm. Then you're in for a long wait. You see cops don't talk to anybody else but cops, wives and girlfriends. They don't know Jack until they come home and there's brains about it all over the wall. You're exaggerating. What do you say? Look, the job comes first. Cancel dates, unanswered questions, mood swings, and if you have kids with cops, you can count on raising them your own damn self. There's one thing I know about JC, is that he takes a big part in raising his son. Well, have you ever talked to the boys and mother? I'm sure she might sing a different tone. You obviously don't know him. I know him better than you do and I just met him. Give JC a message for me. Tell him not to let it get to me. Not let what gets to me. If he wants you to know, he'll tell you. All right. Something wrong? Hey, yeah, I'm sorry. I meant to call you. I just... That's okay. Don't worry about it. What happened? Just this case I'm working on. You know, the whole thing went bust. It's even a bad taste in my mouth. Well, I'm a good listener if you want somebody to talk to. Oh, thanks. Okay. Well, tell me later. Well, do. Oh, yeah, that girl that was here earlier. Where? Yeah. She told me to tell you don't let it get to you. She said that, huh? Yeah, she's wanting to talk. Did she say where she was going? Sorry. We'll go. See you later. Listen, this one shouldn't know I really did want to see you tonight. Yeah, me too. All right. So, how do you want to handle this time? We're going to close this case and soon. Oh, it's a suicide. Donnie, you tried to cover for his partner. It took his gun from the scene. And we go for a warrant. Every cop on the squire is going to be out on his life. No, he'll be stupid to keep it anyway. The wife, the wife, the weak link. We get her alone itself. I wish we were going to do this. It means Donnie his career. It means wife's pension. I don't know what I'm supposed to think of, Phil. Well, I know this. Just because he pulled a trigger doesn't mean the job didn't kill him. Oh, no, no, no. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Oh, yeah. That's the two things. Yeah. You know how loving up on life is best of way. You know how loving tonight is a warm thing. You know how loving. May I help you? You know? Yeah. Come here. So I thought you were going to North Carolina. I don't like the country. So, so why do you live there then? I just sheep. She looks like women. Why do you live there? It's too much. I just don't know. You know, I do. She's like, hmm. What are you looking for, Williams? You have no business poking around in my fight. Crack gave this to me, OK? What does he have against you anyway? I was his partner. And I never told him that our witness had contact with the relative. I lost my job, and Alex lost a promotion. So is that the reason why your witness was killed? Oh, yeah. He loved his wife, and they knew it. She refused to go into the program. You can't say that a blamer. All you get for your civic duty is a new birth certificate in $1,200 a month or a year and a half. So why did he come forward? Because he was a damn fool who didn't know. He witnessed a murder. He mined your own business. You don't make a description. You don't think of the bastards in line up. You don't give up your life because it's the right thing to do. I don't think so. OK. Oh, come on. It's OK. It'll be nice to me when. OK, you don't need to cry, all right? Let's go get some rest. All right? OK. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. What's it called nothing? I can't breathe. Don't you want nothing? Oh, I'm afraid. Oh, yeah. Oh, don't let go. You have my room. Yeah. Oh, don't let go. I didn't tell myself that we could be more than this friend. I know you think that when we'll do it, would all end up in a different way. You know when we'd do it. Okay. Come on. Show us the character now. OK. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh, please. Do come on. Got everything? Come on. I don't want to break up. Hi. You have to, oh, this is embarrassing. I've never used justice to a advocacy yourself towards that organization. She is shooting you up. There, I have it. Now that u got to chat up, why didn't she grandma say you were going? What's up... Don't you want something? Don't you want to go, and pray? Do we have to go? Don't let go Don't let go Cause I'm right to you Cause you're right You're right You're right I say you, I swear I can do Control Yeah Oh Don't let go Don't let go Don't let go Don't let go Yeah, what's up? What's up? Swinging to deputy marshals were ambushed Pracks on my ass and the feds are trying to take over my priest and other than that, Williamson's quiet Did you say ambushed? When? I've seen her because description was seen at the hotel I want to know what points out on her and I want this mess cleared up before the breast or a human being It wasn't her Williamson, I know how you feel She's been through it and then some, but now it's out of my hands No, no tenant, I know that it wasn't her Because she was with me last What's yours with you? Yeah, she was with me Where is she now? She's at the hotel Don't get it towards us What? What? I told you everything that I knew You yelled, hey, you know we got that Now, there wasn't much missing from your place Maybe they got scared when I shut my husband Why was Officer Vincent seeing a police drink? I thought that was confidential It is That's why I'm asking I don't know You didn't ask? He said it was for the job For the job or because of it She cops lose it all the time Need to get it off their chest, we cheat on our spouses We drink, even eat our guns We got her saying around the squad If you can get two shots off before the end, you're real hard-ass He didn't kill himself Then how did he get powder burns on his hand? We have a test for that Camille We checked his reports he hadn't fight his weapon in weeks And it was broken glass outside the window But the perks broke in The glass would have been on the floor We're not stupid He said you wouldn't know He said you wouldn't know He said you wouldn't know He said you wouldn't know What time did you need the precinct? After everything has happened, you can't believe that I did this But you didn't pull the trigger because the detective William said you were together Then why am I? Because you went to the regional town He swam was being held there before being moved to a safe house And somehow, you're pretty the last found that out I wasn't here There was a lot of people who were in the hospital They were in the hospital You're pretty the last found that out I wasn't here Yes you were, because somebody I did your photo If I was with Williams, how do you explain it? Revenge Change, record. This was a little tired You know, you're not the only one with a girl, Jerica As of yesterday, Russell B. William, get back here Prove it Oh, I will. And I can't And I got this I got it I guess I know how you feel, huh? A trade used Then you get angry, right? And payback is the only thing that you can think about until she becomes a bitch all of a sudden It's about right, isn't it? I mean, you played me well, girl I mean, who else better than vouchers on a cup? It wasn't like that But this time I'll play you, right? Now you're right We can improve it. You're going to have to cooperate And trust me when I tell you, you will when I'm done with you I'm out of here You should share this right here Now you went to bait, you told him where to find Swain You told him how the marsh was operating He ends up dead So whether or not you gave it to him for free Or you sold it to him, you did it, we know it And you're going to pay for that How will you? You're going to go to baits Just like you did And I'm going to tell him we got you on two counts of conspiracy to murder US deputy marshals and one Kevin Swain Then I'm going to tell him It's just a matter of time before you serve him up to us on a plate Who thank you, Paul String? I will, Willie And you're willing to take that risk I don't believe you It's not just that Come talk to us T know! Damn Right Good about to make sure you cover my ass. You're a protected witness, whether I like it or not. I told you before, we'll do anything to get Bates even to give you a deal. Listen, the first is wired in the lining. The page where it's backup. Now, the range isn't good or not the one, so we're going to have to be close. Just get Bates to say something and premonating, and then we'll come in. I know what you mean. Williams. Come on, have a minute. I never meant to hurt you. I just couldn't let Swayne get away again. Let me ask you something. If you get away with doing the same thing, then what makes you different than him? Look, I couldn't take the national interest anymore. The smitches and the finks, double dipping between federal agencies. There's been a $100 million. The smitches last year. The smite was the last straw. That's very noble, Erica. What you read a book. The reason why I chose you is because I knew you wouldn't need me twisting in the wind. Most cops, they would have never opened their mouths about us. It was not my morals that I questioned. It was my taste. Move your hands a little to the left. I might get something out of this, too. Just clean. For a woman, you travel very late. Make up's in the car. You want it? Some men appreciate a shop, waiting to female. I'm not going to be able to do that. Some men appreciate a shop, waiting to female. I'm not one of them. When we talked yesterday, you didn't seem to mind. I don't know what you're talking about. I gave you a freebie. You said butchers instead of somebody subtle. So I'll get to the point. I got cops asking me questions. I don't like it. It's not because some of them are fidgety. They haven't said a damn thing we can use. I could give you a loan to help you. Straighten out your problems. Unfortunately, don't keep any cash. Come on, do something, rock. How much we talking here? I gave you swans whereabouts. Two marshals got killed. How much you need? Enough to get lost. Fair enough. Call my associate. He'll take care of you. You know what she's doing? You're proud. Your witness is leaving. She left one of the transmitters in the office. We have to stay in range. How is it going? So where we going anyway? You know what? I know this city like the back of my hand. You take half done, you're going to hit traffic. Then we should turn off this street. I wish we'd just stayed there. I'd lost you earlier, static. Okay, I got a little help. Don't worry, Clark. Yes, sir. I understand. Okay. Don't take this person like the one who likes people sitting behind me. If you could just leave her alone. I wish they'd show her. Where is he? Come on, is there anything coming through? Yeah. What's it? I want his phone plate. enterprise for you, Nick. And he's coming, identify. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Hey, fucker! Get out of there! Get out of there! Get out of there! I want an answer! Get out of there! Get in there! What the hell is she doing? Hear me talking to you! Hey, see! Get out of there! Oh, that's my... You're done now. Sit down, Don, if you, unless you want to tell your story to one police plaza. What difference does it make who I talk to? The girls in the report that you staged this whole thing, the brass won't be satisfied with just your resignation. Did Officer Vincent take his own life? Maybe you forgot what it's like out there on the street. And hell, you gold shields don't show up till the smoke's cleared anyway. You're still gonna have to... I believe in you. You don't see some guy beating the crap out of his wife? I want some kid, but her brain's out. And you never find out why. So, Eats has gotten lady to clean up his mess? He was my partner. What's this? Officer Todd Vincent died from a gunshot wound fired by an unknown assailant. Hey, Bonjour. If you're looking for Jeanne, he went that way with Nikki. No, I thought I'd come see you and say hello. Hello. So, um, how have you been? I've been all right. Haven't seen you around in a while. Yeah, um, you know that woman who's worked on that case? Yeah, Erika. Well, she was killed. J.C., I'm so sorry. I had me, too. So, I needed to, you know, just take time away. I know we didn't get off to the best start. So, what I want to try to do is make it up to you. I don't think that'll be a good idea. Why not? J.C., I don't always know what I want, but I know what I don't want. What's this? It's a second place. Not over a woman, not over a job, nothing. Who's talking about second place? And then, you know, people settle. And that's not me. So... Prince? I'm Rosanna Scotto coming up next for the second time this week, a serious accident at a New York airport. We'll go inside the home of the cult of death. New details on how they took their own lives. Plus, their eerie final message. Why were they so concerned about a comet in some UFOs? Also, a head by by Hyves Control Fee, the judge tells OJ to pay up. There's a videotape that might help police find notorious BIG's killer. You'd better make sure you pay all your tickets when you see this woman coming with her computer or else. Why Charles Manson doesn't want to be free. And Martin Luther King Jr's son goes face to face with James Earl Ray. Put down that remote, the 10 o'clock news is next. Welcome to my world. Come on this fast, you stay."

Tenhas umas ideias muito estranhas nessa cabecinha. Eu gosto de minha ideia. Dois ovos em vez de um. Minha crida, Maia, experi\u00eancia prova que \u00e9 melhor um ovo. Mas diga-l\u00e1 porque \u00e9 melhor. Fazimos divis\u00f5es maiores para mais ovos. Anda, vamos l\u00e1. Ah, que bem que cheira! Que fome!

        "translated": "The story that I'm going to tell That is a skirt of magic and color And an old woman will talk About nature and its tendencies I ask the illusion, wasn't it Maiar In the world the infantesia came out Maiia I will always roast It continues to enchant, it is always The insert uses the lard Maiar Maiia her friends adventure Maiia became the pain Maiia, maiia, maiia It's to call, a whole esumen, maiia There is no Hello friends, as you can see? I'm a grasshopper My name is Flipe, I hope you like me I know I'm weird, but I'll come here often I don't know what I'll be like What can I tell you about Today nothing interesting has happened to me yet It seems that the life of a grasshopper can be very boring Spending the day eating grass and raiding one side or the other isn't very annoying Very annoying, although I like to eat Gustava If only the brilheta were my friend It's navigating and insane of kisses Bring it to me Those little ones are so hard-working that those who even work too much I'll always be here Hello Warm up, I'm taking a very nice little drop today It's just like them, always busy all day long They don't even have time to say it here, it's typical Until I drop the sapel Why did they come back so soon? I'm going to stay much longer But why? What could happen? This bore-bore-ing is not at all common Maybe we'll get lucky and something interesting will happen Hello, my little owl Would you like to take a walk? Can you talk? No, I don't think you can talk And you're still very young, the only thing you know how to do is open your mouth You must be hungry I know, there must be trouble in the hive It's on the other side of the ruined castle Behind that big rock It's a safe and pleasant place What's going on? Why won't you let me in? Don't you know who I am? If the safe one doesn't come out, you can't get in. I don't need a skirt. Cassandra was your teacher when you were in school. Today is the big day of my birth. If they don't let me in, all the little girls will die. Look carefully at people before you say you don't know them. It has to have been a safe place, and don't forget it was a safe place. It's not important for people before you say you don't know them. We have a lot to be sorry for, but we have rules to follow. There are a lot of people who try to get in to blow their tops, and we are the ones who are responsible. One should have enough common sense to change the rules at a moment as important as this. Never to be fooled, my fool. If we had known it was so important. And now can I get in? Oh, if Cassandra is to come back inside. Finally, we've been waiting for a long time. They must be almost ready to play. Here they come, come on. Don't get out of here. How did I get out of here? Is it so I can admit it? Oh... It's Maya. What do I have to do with it? Hello, is anyone home? Yes, Maya. We've been waiting for you here. You were the last one in Asia. Who's Maya? It's me, Maya. Why did you call me Maya? Call me, please. Well, actually, there's no special reason. Does everyone have a name? Oh, does your lady have a name too? Yes, my name is Cassandra. I'll take care of you and have fun. Come here. Come in, I trust you, it's hot. It's your fault, the others left a long time ago. Why live so long? I had a beautiful dream. A dream, but Maya works at Cass\u00f4nia. Maybe one day he'll tell you my dream was so fun. Well, I'm just Cassandra, come and get me. Wait, I'll go get you. Calm down, wait. Your life is just beginning and there's so much to learn. What am I doing? I'm learning to live and I'm calling you. And I'm calling you? What's that? Bees are always calling me. Why? It's a little hard to understand first, I'll teach you some easier things. Why do they do that? We bees have been doing this since we were born. And why do bees do this? Why do you call me Cassandra? I want to know why? How am I going to learn anything about life if you don't explain it to me? If you're patient, Maya, you won't be able to tell me. I can explain everything at once. Oh, let's go to the others. And they lay their eggs inside the combs. And why do they do that? The eggs stay inside the combs and after a few weeks a little bee is born, like what happened to you. You were in the egg, and with those? Get dressed. See how they lay the egg in each little hole. Then another bee comes along and makes the inspector know. Only the workers only work inside the hive. They are the ones who build the hive and take care of the eggs. I always have a lot to do, because every day the bee and the teacher eat a large number of eggs. I don't think you remember what it was like when you were in the egg, do you? Oh! Where is that little bee? It's heavy. Acaki! Oh, there you are! Teacher, Cassandra is saying the same thing to you. Great, but it's only one egg per little hole. But why? If the eggs were in pairs, they could talk to us with the others. That way they wouldn't feel so alone anymore. Maia, our bees weren't born to talk, we were born to work. I'm very worried about the tick. You have some very strange ideas in that little head of yours. I like my idea. Two eggs instead of one. My dear, Maia, experience proves that one egg is better. But tell me why it's better. We make bigger divisions for more eggs. Come on, let's go. Oh, how good it smells! How hungry! And the smell you're smelling is really good, it's honey. And what you're doing is really good ... And it's really good what you're doing. And it's really good what you're doing. And it's really good what you're doing. Why did you gnash with a lot of \uadfc\ub370is? Why did you gnash with a lot of \u00fczinho? Why did you gnash with a lot too? Why did you compete pisteorious? Why did you mushroom bat Cristoephercinha. Why did you enejou, pisteuous? Why did you enejou, pistei inadequate. Why did you enejou, pisteilich gave. Why did you enejou, pisteiczy! Why did you enejou, pistei\u03ba\u03b9 magnifique, punk, punk, punk, punk, punk, punk, punk, punk, punk, punk, punk, punk, punk, punk, punk... Why did youuu\u0443\u043b\u044c, pisteiichi chewy wat j\u4ec0\u9ebc? Why did you go with the established amnib amendment? Why did you forget the hard, sticky, spiced detached? Ah! This is delicious! Ah! Ah! Ah! It's the same old black stuff! Getting all dirty, maia! A honey tastes good! But it's so because it's juicy that I can't move my hands! Even though I see the color of a food. Even though I see the color of a food. Even though I see the color of a food. Now that they're older, Go take them on a trip to the outside world to see the sky. Providence Cassandra, you can say it's the sky you were waiting for! Wait until we get there, then I'll explain everything, but don't you think the outside world is just fun? Little bees can't walk outside alone and understand themselves. Ah! Ah! It's dangerous to have to understand how cruel it is to be very careful! If I know by soracassandra, I haven't been to school for two years! Then you must know that this is a sin on me once again, exercising the worst 10 times greater than us! Be very careful with them! Don't be afraid to vote for your seats! There is no time to be inside with the sock! They can't come in, so you don't need to be afraid of any, my little one! This is a frog! It never flies and very low over the water! If not, this is what can happen! They have a very long tongue! Don't worry and the frogs will never be able to come in here! Ah! Providence Cassandra, does this mean that we should never go near the frogs? That's right, Ili, don't forget! You are Ili! Yes, I am Ili! You seem to be very clever! No, I haven't been to class for two years! Well, I am the frog! half! I've heard that about myself! Yes, but only terrible things! You ask people so many questions that they would scream! The world can be very cruel! For example, when it rains it's not at all pleasant! When that happens, vote at home, you condominium fan! If it's raining outside, what's the best thing a bumblebee can do? Do you want to be the one to answer the question? Well, we had to stay home! What would happen if we didn't stay home, teacher? Did I tell you, dear, what's that noise? Please, don't move from your seats and I'll be right back! What's going on? There must be something wrong? Maia, Maia, Maia, where are you going? Come back! Come back here! Go back outside! No, Maia! Maia, come back! It's not safe and go outside! Oh, why are you? Do you want to be the one to do it? Oh, no, no, no, no! Oh, no, no, no! Oh, no, no, no! Oh, no, no, no! It's mine! No, it's not! It's not! No, no, no! Everything goes with that pot! What are you going through here? Okay, no more snoring, my little one! The elder is the oldest, watch out if you get some orgasm! The elder is responsible, I'll pass on what I say! No, no, no! Look, a flea! It's not just one time for the series, it's the one we saw before, it's just a figure, but since I'm responsible, I'll show you something else! That's a stag, isn't it? And also a stag! I've seen a series, it was called Smart, and it really was one! Oh, in seed! No, it's not? That's a lion inside! No, no, no, no! No, no, no! No, it's not! That's a lion inside! No, no, no, no! No, no, no! No, no, no! No, no! What's so strong that's left out there? It's really not nice at all. The sky is no longer alone. Teacher Cassandra says it was alone. What are you doing? What are you doing? You must be hanging out and studying. Thank you, Willi. You can go back to your place. Maya, can you tell me what this is? Ah! But where is she? Can anyone tell me where she is? Can anyone tell me where she is? Did anyone see me leave? Yes, teacher. I saw her leave. That's exactly where she went. To see the storm. But what do you want? You have to keep an eye on that girl all the time. A world is through Linda. A world is through Linda. How funny is it that I drive in green? A world is through Linda. Like a car of a star is always turning. Turning is always turning. One in two and three with me is fun. So, the return will see. You make me understand this is Brazil. When we try hard, sireo. The offense. Lady in me sells dance with me. Sing with me, jump with me. Whoever has fun and toys with me. Come dance, jump with me. One of the three with a celestra car is always spinning. Yes, it's spinning. It's spinning. Well, dance and spin with me. One of the three. Like a celestra car is always spinning. Yes, it's spinning. It's spinning. Much more virtuous and fun. Very good, very good. Maia! Maia! Where are you, Maia? Where are you? Answer me promptly. It's that Sandra, you teacher! Maia! Where are you, Maia? Maia! Now everything that I see is over. You always get into trouble. You saw a little bee. If you're looking for that other life of mine, it's over there. Let me stay there for a few minutes to see if you learn your lesson. Maia! You, teacher, are the ones who Sandra... She should take advantage of now that you're locked up to screw you over. You were very naughty, Maia. I'm going to have to punish you and send you to bed right now. Oh, but I didn't do anything wrong, I just wanted to see the storm! I don't care if you cause yourself a lot of trouble. Sorry person! And don't go out to explore the world again. Okay? Sorry person. Go! Stop standing there blind and get some sleep. Why are you such a fool just for wanting to see the world outside? Next time you'll be smarter and run away when no one is looking. I never have anything to find."

Ya ya lejos ve un enjambre de abejas. Habran estado recogiendo miel. Hay que reconocer que las alejas son muy trabajadoras. Creo que vuelve a su colmena. Buenos d\u00edas, se\u00f1oras. Buenos d\u00edas. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no dejan caer alguna cotita? Una cotita, una cotita. Bueno, que tenga mucho que hacer por lo menos dar los buenos d\u00edas. Que comportamiento tan raro no es habitual en ellas. No es habitual en absoluto. \u00bfEntonces tan sombrero? \u00a1C\u00f3ngel! \u00a1Ese tan roguiento que mi sombrero se vuela! Pero ya est\u00e1n aqu\u00ed otra vez. De mi ocurrir algo extraordinario. \u00a1Oh, ygan! \u00bfQu\u00e9 les pasa? \u00a1Qu\u00e9 raro! Vuelan de ac\u00e1 para all\u00e1. De all\u00e1 para ac\u00e1. \u00bfC\u00f3mo lo ocas? Una peque\u00f1a o dandum paseo. \u00a1Ehehe! No debes tra\u00f1aros que no me contestes, que no sabe hablar a\u00fan. Es como los ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os abre su boquita tan solo para que le dente comer. Tengo una idea, ya que en la colmena le ocurr\u00eda algo especial. \u00bfQu\u00e9 os parece si vamos all\u00e1 para enterarnos? \u00a1Eh! En aquel castillo, al lado del gran abeto est\u00e1 la colmena. \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no me dej\u00e1is entrar? \u00bfNo sab\u00e9is qui\u00e9n soy? La contra se\u00f1a sin contra se\u00f1a no hay paso. Pero bueno, es que no me reconoces, soy Cassandra. La que te he ense\u00f1ado todo lo que sea. \u00bfEn serio? Ya lo he dicho, \u00bfen qu\u00e9 se ha hecho? \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no me dej\u00e1is entrar? \u00bfNo sab\u00e9is qui\u00e9n soy? La contra se\u00f1a sin contra se\u00f1a no hay paso. Pero bueno, es que no me reconoces. Soy Cassandra. La que te he ense\u00f1ado todo lo que sabes, yo he sido tu maestra. \u00bfQu\u00e9 hagas?

Por favor, tranquilices, se\u00f1orita, la cerradar comprendemos, pero de vez comprendernos, tambi\u00e9n a nosotros tenemos \u00f3rdenes que cumplir. Yo tambi\u00e9n tengo que haber cero \u00f3rdenes, pero hay que saber distinguir cuando una \u00f3rdenes, una \u00f3rdenes, cuando debe dejar de ser los y el caso es urgente. Nosotros no pod\u00edamos saber que tuviera tanta importancia. Bueno, \u00bfme dej\u00e1is pasar o no? Pero claro, naturalmente, p\u00e1sidest\u00e9. Bien, ya estoy aqu\u00ed, espero no llegar tan. No, no, va a empezar en cualquier momento. Ya empieza a venga de prisa. \u00a1Ah! \u00a1No la carros doras en pila! \u00a1Oh, mira! \u00a1R\u00e1pido, daros cruzos! \u00a1Misa! \u00bfQu\u00e9 es esto? \u00bfEs que no hay nadie? \u00bfEs que no se abre? \u00bfVaya a puje que muero, verdad? \u00bfQu\u00e9 es esto? \u00bfEs que escuchar? \u00bfTiene que ser magia? Todo lo tiene que hacer una misma. \u00a1Ah! \u00bfNo hay nadie? Pues claro que hay alguien saldo una red magia. Vamos a te prisa, es la \u00fanica que falta. \u00a1Maya, qui\u00e9n es magia! \u00bfEs que me haya suyido? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 me apeste este sin nombre? \u00a1D\u00edame! Pues no hay ninguna razon especial simplemente, porque cada una ten\u00e9is que tener un nombre. \u00a1Ah! \u00bfY este tambi\u00e9n tiene un nombre? S\u00ed, yo soy la se\u00f1orita Casandra y hasta que seas mayor ni ocupar\u00e9 de ti. \u00a1Ah! Me alegro de haber salido, estaba muy incomodo. \u00bfT\u00fa has tenido la culpa? \u00bfYos dem\u00e1s han salido y ha cerrado? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no saliste antes peque\u00f1a? \u00bfEs que estaba se\u00f1alando una cosa muy bonita? \u00bfQu\u00e9 dices? Una beja so\u00f1ando? Hay que ver. \u00bfQuieres que se lo cuente? \u00bfEra una cosa muy divertida? \u00a1Wy! \u00bfC\u00f3mo funciona esto? Tengo que saltar a dinabuzcarme. Espera, iria a buscar temaya. \u00a1Ah! Me va a coger en Mir\u00e1me. \u00a1Ponte que\u00f1a, ven! Si acabaron los sue\u00f1os. Ven, ahora te espera la realidad. Tendr\u00e1s que aprender muchas cosas. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 volando para aqu\u00ed? Est\u00e1n empezando a reunirse para el enjambre. \u00bfQu\u00e9 es eso? No he dicho que se reunen para el enjambre. No lo comprendo. Es muy pronto para que t\u00fa lo comprendas. Primero tendr\u00e1s que aprender cosas m\u00e1s encilla. \u00bfY para que lo hacen? \u00bfEh? Porque las abejas hacemos esto desde que empezamos a existir. \u00bfY porque las abejas hacemos esto? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no me lo explica? Pero de manera que yo lo comprenda. \u00a1Mara! \u00bfY c\u00f3mo voy a comprender las cosas y nadie me lo explica? Pero peque\u00f1a una cosa tras otra no todas al mismo tiempo. Ven, vamos con los dem\u00e1s. Bueno, vale. \u00bfY por qu\u00e9? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 una cosa tras otra? Porque t\u00fa cabecitas demasiado peque\u00f1a para comprenderlas todas. Espera, se\u00f1orita. Ya s\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 no me lo dice. Porque este tampoco lo sabe. Porque se r\u00ede usted. Yo no lo encuentro tan gracioso. \u00a1Qu\u00e9 jaleo! \u00a1Qu\u00e9 jaleo! \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa, t\u00edo? Parece que van a enjanbrar. Por eso hay tanta excitaci\u00f3n. En realidad no pasa m\u00e1s la sensaci\u00f3n. En el d\u00eda de los nacimientos hay demasiadas abejas en la colmena y la mitad tiene que migrar para buscarse una colmena nueva. Esto ya lo he visto muchas veces. Pero como no hay nada m\u00e1s interesante, seguir\u00e9 habiendo como las abejas van y di\u00e9le. \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya! \u00a1No mayas por all\u00ed! \u00a1No! \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no? Eso ya lo veas m\u00e1s adelante. Y a favor de no preguntar tanto. Me vas a volverlojando. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9? Pero hay diafrentes de mi claro que hay all\u00ed. \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya, qu\u00e9 es hacia aqu\u00ed! Para que se salen un daster\u00eda, pero yo no puedo salir. Si lo sabes, voy a ver ahora mismo. \u00a1En buenos d\u00edas, se\u00f1orita! \u00a1Oi! Pero es que soy tan feo que le doy miedo, se\u00f1orita. \u00bfQu\u00e9 es? \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa, Andra? \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1? \u00bfQu\u00e9? Por fin miraste a ti, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9? \u00bfQu\u00e9 es? \u00bfPera flip? El saltamonte es un tipo bastante vago. Vive completamente solo algo intonprecible para las abejas. \u00a1Ara, voy por all\u00ed! \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Adi\u00f3s, se\u00f1orita! \u00a1Qu\u00e9 chiquilla est\u00e1! \u00a1Esc\u00fachame bien, Maya! No puedo perder todo mi tiempo contigo. Espero que lo puedas comprender. S\u00ed, la comprendo, pero \u00bfqu\u00e9 hacen all\u00ed? Con esto hayan paneles nuevos. Y dentro de los paneles coloca los huevos. \u00bfY para qu\u00e9 lo hacen? En los paneles los huevos est\u00e1n protegidos. Y al cabo de algunas semanas nacen peque\u00f1as abejas como t\u00fa. \u00a1Yo he sido un huevecito como ese! Naturalmente. \u00bfMe es como colocan un huevo en cada celda? Lo ves? Ahora viene otra beja y gierra la entrada con cera. Esas son las abejas sobre eras que trabajan solamente en la colmena. Ellas construyen los paneles y cuidan de los huevos. Tienen que trabajar mucho porque nuestra reina pone muchos huevos diariamente. Seguramente no te puedes imaginar que tu alg\u00fan d\u00eda tambi\u00e9n fuiste un huevo, \u00bfverdad? \u00a1Oh, Maya! \u00bfD\u00f3nde se ha metido esa peque\u00f1a? Ay, como pisa. \u00a1Ah! \u00a1Lo que he conseguido! \u00a1Est\u00e1 y arriba! \u00a1Me se\u00f1orita, casanralla, los he atendido! Espera un momento, solo un huevo en cada celda. \u00bfY por qu\u00e9? Cuando salgan si son dos podr\u00e1n entretenerse. De la otra manera es demasiado aburrido. Pero Maya, nosotros no veremos este mundo para entretenernos y no para trabajar. No me aprendes, hija, miya. Yo nunca tuve pensamientos tan extra\u00f1os como t\u00fa. Sin embargo, creo que las huevos en una celda es mejor. Pero la experiencia de cientos de a\u00f1os nos ha ense\u00f1ado que es mejor as\u00ed. \u00bfY por qu\u00e9 es mejor as\u00ed? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no se hacen celda? \u00bfGrantes para muchos huevos? Vengo el mig\u00f3s y dame. \u00bfQu\u00e9 hay en huele aqu\u00ed? \u00bfY d\u00f3nde viene? \u00bfVes? \u00bfEst\u00e1n entrando de repente? \u00a1Muchas hambre! Ya lo s\u00e9, es por la miel que est\u00e1 soliendo. \u00a1Aqu\u00ed! Pero \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 no se mueve tiene que mover? D\u00e9jalo, ves demasiado para ti. \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1 llena de miel? S\u00ed, aqu\u00ed se guarda la miel para el invierno. \u00a1Maya, me en aqu\u00ed ahora mismo! Una beja no debe ser golosa. Se\u00f1orita, ac\u00e1 se andra esta riqu\u00edsima. \u00a1Oh, finillo! \u00a1Muchas cantas! \u00a1Ay, qu\u00e9 ver, c\u00f3mo te has puesto! Est\u00e1 muy rica, pero muy pegajosa. Ay, no puedo moverme. Ma\u00f1ana o a los humo pasado ma\u00f1ana vais a salir por primera vez a ver el cielo azul. Se\u00f1orita, ac\u00e1 se andra. \u00bfPuedes explicarme qu\u00e9 es un cielo azul? Espera que puedas salir de la colmena. Entonces te lo explicar\u00e9 todo. Pero no te creas que fuera toda esta diversi\u00f3n. Ninguna peque\u00f1a beja de bipolar sola fuera. \u00bfMe entiendas? O sea, se esperan muchos peligros y deb\u00e9is aprender cu\u00e1l son para evitarlos. S\u00ed, s\u00ed, se\u00f1orita, ac\u00e1 se andra yo. Yo ya lo s\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 he suspendido dos veces. Bueno, Willi, entonces t\u00fa sabr\u00e1s que este es un avisp\u00f3n nuestro peor enemigo. Es diez veces m\u00e1s grande que nosotros. Cuidaros mucho de no encontraros con el ni\u00f1o. \u00a1Ahh! No, no os quer\u00eda asustar. Volveza vuestro sitio r\u00e1pido. Aqu\u00ed dentro no haya vispones. Nuestras viejas abejas tienen mucho cuidado. No teng\u00e1is miedo. En esta l\u00e1mina veis a una rana. No vol\u00e9is nunca demasiado cerca del agua. Si su larga y pegaba salengua os atrapa alguna vez. No hay forma de escapar. \u00a1Ahh! Bueno, calma, calma. \u00bfA qui\u00e9n nunca podr\u00eda entrar a una rana? Se\u00f1orita, significa eso que no debemos acercarnos nunca a los sitios donde hay ranas. As\u00ed es, Willi, no lo olvides. \u00bfT\u00fa te llamas Willi? S\u00ed, yo soy Willi. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 tienes esa boteantrara? Es la pubertad, ya tengo dos a\u00f1os. Bueno, yo soy Maya. \u00bfA lo mejoras o\u00edr hablar de m\u00ed? S\u00ed, pero solo cosas madas. Vuelvez lo cada se\u00f1orita con tus preguntas y cosas as\u00ed. Como todo en esta vida el mundo tiene dos caras. Una bonita y otra menos bonita. Si, por ejemplo, yo he veo aitormentano, es nada bonito. En ese caso hay que volver inmediatamente a la colmena o buscar refugio debajo de las hojas. Por ejemplo, hoy que llueve ya hay mucho viento. \u00bfQu\u00e9 debe hacer una peque\u00f1a beja obediente? \u00bfNo sabes t\u00fa, Willi? S\u00ed, nos quedamos en la colmena. \u00bfY qu\u00e9 le ocurrir\u00eda una beja que sale con este tiempo? \u00bfQu\u00e9? \u00bfQu\u00e9 ya si te acabo de explicar? Pero qu\u00e9 l\u00edo es este? \u00bfQu\u00e9 daros en vuestros sitios enseguidos vuelvo, vale? No, no, no, no. \u00bfQu\u00e9 tenemos? \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa? Creo que con esta tormenta se deben de cerrar todas las puertes suelas. \u00bfD\u00f3nde vas? Vaya a ver qu\u00e9 hay fuera. Pero, pero Maya qued\u00f3 a ti. Maya, no debes salir. Ven aqu\u00ed. \u00a1Ay! \u00a1Ay! \u00a1Ay! \u00a1Ay! \u00a1Ay! \u00a1Ay, ah\u00ed! \u00a1S\u00ed que haces! \u00a1Ay! \u00a1Ay! \u00a1No veo qu\u00e9 te hizo! \u00a1Porque por el resto! \u00a1Qu\u00e9 toque! \u00a1Qu\u00e9 toque! \u00a1Ay!

        "translated": "In a political country, the rape, the beja under the sun. And she was famous in the place. The Maya beja. And by faith she stops calling Maya. Rescue from the voice to the morning. It's going to be the move without disar. In her world without evil there is no problem that I am not a manga pio. The betrayal is found to the Maya beja. It's going to be the move that no Maya. Maya. Maya. Maya. Maya. The birth of Maya. The pilias bekas the downloading infraestructiles. Well doe of the things. Do not triumph! You preferably. You uniges them. Well, at this moment I don't know what to tell you because lately it seems that nothing happens around here. You can believe me the life of a grasshopper. That time it is quite boring, always jumping from one side to another and eating grass. It becomes monotonous. Monootona! I'm going to take a look. Oh look! A butterfly. Now, far away, he sees a swarm of bees. They must have been collecting honey. You have to admit that the bees are very hard-working. I think they're going back to their hive. Good morning, ladies. Good morning. Why don't they drop a few? A little bit, a little bit. Well, I hope they have a lot to do, at least say good morning. Such strange behavior is not usual for them. It is not usual at all. So, so hat? Freeze! He's so red that my hat flies off! But here they are again. Something extraordinary happened to me. Oh, come on! What's the matter with them? How strange! They fly here and there. From there to here. How do you know? A little walk or dandum. Hehe! You shouldn't be surprised that they don't answer me, they don't know how to talk yet. It's like little children opening their little mouths just to be fed. I have an idea, because something special happened to them in the hive. What do you say we go there and find out? Hey! In that castle, next to the big fir tree is the beehive. What's the matter? Why won't you let me in? Don't you know who I am? The password without the password is no way through. But anyway, you don't recognize me, I'm Cassandra. The one who taught you everything you know. Really? I've already said it, what has it been like? What's the matter? Why won't you let me in? Don't you know who I am? The password without the password is no way through. But anyway, you don't recognize me. I'm Cassandra. The one who taught you everything you know, I've been your teacher. What are you going to do? Today is a great day. The cer\u00e1n is not for being hands and sisters, but if you don't let me in, it is Cristiano. And you here making me waste my time. Please, calm down, young lady, we understand the closing, but from time to time we understand each other, we also have orders to follow. I also have to have zero orders, but you have to know when an order, an order, when it must stop being the case and the case is urgent. We couldn't know that it was so important. Well, will you let me through or not? But of course, naturally, you pass. Well, I'm here now, I hope it doesn't take long. No, no, it's going to start any minute. It's already starting to come quickly. Ah! Don't pile the carts in a pile! Oh, look! Quick, give each other crosses! Mass! What is this? Is there no one? Is it not opening? Go on, I'll die, right? What is this? Do you have to listen? Does it have to be magic? It has to be done by one person. Ah! Is there no one? Of course there is someone, a magic net. Let's hurry, it's the only one missing. Maya, who is magic! Did she take me? Why does this nameless one stink? Tell me! There is no special reason, simply because each of you has to have a name. Ah! And this one has a name too? Yes, I am Miss Cassandra and until you are older I will not bother you. Ah! I am glad I left, I was very uncomfortable. Was it your fault? Did the others leave and it closed? Why didn't you leave before, little one? Was she pointing at a very pretty thing? What are you saying? A dreaming bee? Look. Do you want me to tell her? Was it a very funny thing? Wow! How does this work? I have to jump and dive. Wait, I would go look for temaya. Ah! I'm going to go to take in Look at me. Get on your hind legs, come! Dreams are over. Come, now reality awaits you. You will have to learn many things. Why are you flying here? They are beginning to gather for the swarm. What is that? I did not say that they gather for the swarm. I do not understand. It is too soon for you to understand. First you will have to learn simpler things. And why do they do it? Eh? Because bees have been doing this since we began to exist. And why do bees do this? Why don't you explain it to me? But in a way that I understand. Mara! And how am I going to understand things and nobody explains them to me? But little one, one thing after another, not all at the same time. Come, let's go with the others. Well, okay. And why? Why one thing after another? Because your little head is too small to understand them all. Wait, young lady. I know why you don't tell me. Because this one doesn't know either. Because you laugh. I don't find it so funny. What a fuss! What a fuss! What's going on, man? It looks like they're going to swarm. That's why there's so much excitement. In reality, the feeling doesn't go away. On the day of the births there are too many bees in the hive and half of them have to migrate to find a new hive. I've seen this many times before. But since there's nothing more interesting, I'll keep on doing it like the bees go and tell it. Maya! Maya! No Mayas over there! No! Why not? You'll see that later. And in favor of not asking so many questions. You're going to drive me crazy. Why? But there are diametrically opposed to me there of course. Maya! Maya, what's this way! They'll get out of there a few yards, but I can't get out. If you know, I'll go see right now. Good morning, miss! Oi! But I'm so ugly that I scare you, miss. What is it? What's the matter, Andra? Where is it? What? You finally looked at yourself, why? What is it? Flip-pear? The grasshopper is a rather lazy fellow. He lives all alone, something that bees don't notice. Oh, I'm coming over there! Maya! Goodbye, young lady! What a little girl you are! Listen to me carefully, Maya! I can't waste all my time with you. I hope you can understand. Yes, I understand, but what are they doing there? They make new panels with these. And inside the panels they place the eggs. And what are they doing it for? The eggs are protected in the panels. And after a few weeks little bees like you are born. I was an egg like that! Naturally. Is it how they put an egg in each cell? Do you see? Now another bee comes and covers the entrance with wax. These are the bees on the threshing floors that work only in the hive. They build the panels and take care of the eggs. They have to work hard because our queen lays many eggs every day. Surely you can't imagine that you were once an egg too, right? Oh, Maya! Where has that little one gone? Oh, how she steps. Ah! What I've got! There she is and up! My lady, Casanralla, I've taken care of them! Wait a minute, only one egg in each cell. And why? When they come out, if there are two of them, they can entertain themselves. The other way is too boring. But Maya, we will not see this world to entertain ourselves and not to work. You don't learn from me, my daughter, miya. I never had such strange thoughts as you. However, I think that eggs in one cell is better. But the experience of hundreds of years has taught us that it is better this way. And why is it better this way? Why don't they make cells? Grants for many eggs? Come on, give me the mig\u00f3s. What's in it? And where does it come from? Do you see? Are they coming in suddenly? Very hungry! I know, it's because of the honey that's leaking. Here! But why doesn't it move? Does it have to move? Leave it, you see too much for yourself. Where is it full of honey? Yes, honey is stored here for the winter. Maya, I'm here right now! A bee must not be greedy. Miss, this is so delicious here. Oh, my! You sing so much! Oh, how you've become! It's so delicious, but so sticky. Oh, I can't move. Tomorrow or the next day You are going out for the first time to see the blue sky. Miss, this is where it is. Can you explain to me what a blue sky is? Wait until you can get out of the hive. Then I will explain everything to you. But don't think it was all fun. No little bipolar bee alone outside. Do you understand me? I mean, there are many dangers to be expected and you must learn what they are in order to avoid them. Yes, yes, miss, this is where I am. I already know because I have failed twice. Well, Willi, then you know that this is a hornet, our worst enemy. It is ten times bigger than us. Be very careful not to meet the boy. Ahh! No, I didn't want to scare you. Go back to your place quickly. There are no hornets in here. Our old bees are very careful. Don't be afraid. In this picture you see a frog. Never fly too close to water. If its long, sticky tongue ever catches you. There is no way to escape. Ahh! Well, calm down, calm down. Who would never want to get into a frog house? Miss, that means we must never go near places where there are frogs. That's right, Willi, don't forget it. Is your name Willi? Yes, I am Willi. Why do you have that froggy face? It's puberty, I'm two years old now. Well, I am Maya. Do you like hearing about me? Yes, but only funny things. Come back to me every lady with your questions and things like that. Like everything in life, the world has two sides. One pretty and one not so pretty. If, for example, I see a storm, it's not pretty at all. In that case, you have to go back to the hive immediately or seek shelter under the leaves. For example, today it's raining and it's very windy. What should a little obedient bee do? Don't you know, Willi? Yes, we stay in the hive. And what would happen to a bee that goes out in this weather? What? What, I've just explained it to you? What's the big deal? What, you two should go back to your places and I'll be right back, okay? No, no, no, no. What's wrong? What's the matter? I think all the doors must be closed with this storm. Where are you going? Go and see what's outside. But, but Maya is left to you. Maya, you mustn't go out. Come here. Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch, there! You do! Ouch! Ouch! I don't see what he did to you! Because for the rest! What a touch! What a touch! Ouch! But anyway, he's not a Florentine. Here! What's going on here? What's going on here? Because, Nora! Come on. Ouch! Now! Can the rest of you shut us up? Guil\u00edn, you're the oldest here, with a little order. No, she saw it! That son! I'm keeping order in all this! No, Nora! Because! Oh, a gabespo! Ah! Nazpo! Ah! But it's not true, it's the one we saw before. You remember us! Since I'm the teacher, now I'm going to show you something else. Now! Now it's a spider. The spider, the spider. That's why it's called a spider. Is that clear? Yes! I saw one in passing. It's called a key and it was playing the violin. Maybe, I think you're crazy! No, no, no, I'm crazy. I'm playing the violin now! This is a tulip, the honey of the tulip! No, no, no, no! You're watching a sample, you have the right here, to call yourself, right? Music! Go see what you do! No! The world is not as wonderful as Sirman. And he says that heaven is made, that all this is beautiful. \u05d4\u05e7! Yes! vendor?\u304b\u3063Cat \ub193a el bleiben. The head is restored. Yes, Unita Cassandra! What are you doing here? And I didn't tell you to stay in your places. The side to play. Very well, where I have come. Now sit down to you. Well, Maya, will you tell me what this is? Oh, Maya, where is it? Did anyone know where it is? Did anyone see it go out? Yes, I saw it. You went out! It was a day too, I wanted to see the storm. Oh! What a naughty little girl! She gives me nothing but trouble, nothing but trouble. Look, she seemed like something else. If only the world were always so full of colors, the sky so blue. There he is. There he is, the funny guy from before. Yes! Yes! La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la! Yes! La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. Balaveja, Maya, I have to take care. If she leaves the hive, but this other viesa that's gonna irritate me Always wanted to play, will have a jump today Far away to look for, my good mesh that returns without value They all tie me or call me Prick I am Frick, fucking Frick I tell the stories that are seen here In my little country I am a jump to mountains that like sun I am Flick They all tie me or call me Flick Ega Frick Ega Frick I am the jump to mountains Flick Vero, Vero, Vero, very well done Malla, Malla, Malla, where could it have gone? Malla, where are you? Answer me Malla, Answer me, I'm Miss Cassandra What's she saying? Why all this shouting If not, behind me right now If by chance you look in the gumen or brat That we almost throw it, you'll find it there Because it says so much nonsense, Malla I should take the opportunity and give you a spanking That you can't move Well, I'm going to tell you one thing and, Jami, how come you don't want to obey me? Nothing I'll punish you and put you to bed right away No need for that There's nothing wrong, I just want you not to add me And everyone does what they want So that the hepas, the curious children sound to me, tipati Well, well, that's enough And I recommend that you stay very still and go to sleep Well, it may turn bad, I'll castrate them But why? If I want to know what the outside world looks like, it's so bad that I know what I'm going to do Next time I'll be more careful so that they don't discover me That's assimilation, yes sir"

How do you use it? A human whose name is written in the book of death? How do you use it? A human whose name is written in the book of death? How do you use it? A human whose name is written in this notebook shall die That's pretty lame, not to mention it twisted It's really not that different from one of those chain letters you get A human whose name is written in this notebook shall die? Come on There must be something wrong with me to even consider it This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his or her name Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next six minutes and 40 seconds So depending on the person you have in mind, you can either kill them easily or painfully This is pretty detailed for a prank, I'll give them that So I write a name in that person dies Like anyone would believe that Wait, on the off chance someone really dies, would that make me a murderer? Yeah right, it's completely impossible The same as Salin who attacks six people at a busy shopping district in Shinjuku yesterday has struck again Taking eight people hostage at this daycare center, his captives include both children and teachers The police have now identified the suspect as 42-year-old Kuro Oto Harada, currently unemployed We expect negotiations to begin immediately A heart attack in 40 seconds, we'll see At the present time, that's all the police are telling us You can't yell but feel concerned for the safety of those hostages You're absolutely right, we'll continue to monitor the situation from here Thank you for that report, what do you make of this Mr. Hashimoto? Well, one can only hope for a quick resolution to this situation Looks like the notebook doesn't work Oh well, I didn't expect it to anyway Wait, we're seeing something here, looks like movement at the front entrance The hostages are coming out, and they all look to be unharmed The special forces are taking action, they're moving in We don't know if the suspect's been arrested Huh? Yes? Okay, we now have confirmation The suspect has been found dead inside I repeat, the suspect is now dead Dead? The special forces are denied allegations that they shot the suspect So it's quite possible he was feeling cornered and decided to commit suicide? According to statements from the hostages, the suspect is suddenly collapsed A heart attack? No way, it's coincidence, this has to be a coincidence Bye It's already 6.30 you know, don't you have cramps, cool tonight? Yeah, I'll be ready in just a sec Death note It's unlikely, but if by chance this thing is for real I have to test it one more time, in which case it should probably be another criminal But if he's too well known, that'll be a problem If he dies, there's a good possibility that news of his death will be covered up I need to see results right away Hey, real buddy What is it, Sudou? Didn't you want to land me $20? Huh? Again? But I can't do that Sudou, maybe I should try killing him No, I should definitely avoid killing people I know And again, does it even really matter? I mean, would anyone really care if a guy like him was to disappear one day? Sweet, looks like we'll be hanging at the arcade after school How can you speak dating party tomorrow? You wanna come? Yeah, of course Oh, there's no way I'm missing that Damn it, why is my mom so useless? She's never here to prick me up on time Once you actually start looking around, it makes you wonder if you'd be doing society a favor by getting rid of all these people Hey, baby! Where you going? Come have a little fun with us That's our taco for you, this guy can spot a hottie a mile away What's up little lady? The name's Taco, Shibui Madu What do you say? Come hang out with us pretty lady Please, I don't want any trouble You hear that? She turns into more trouble Woo! Thank you Let's go boys, it's different downright Are you sure? No, stop! Please! Help me! Now, what will happen? No! No! Hey, wait up! Don't look out! That settles it The death mode, it's for real Oh man, Taco! Stop the kid, he just came out of nowhere Now then, I better get going The End It's been five days Now then, I better get going You headed somewhere to Europe Hey, to tell you that our whole world looks like this That's true, but I've dropped my death note You really messed things up, didn't you? Hold on a sec, didn't you already trick the old man to get a second book? Don't tell me you dropped both of them You must have some idea where you dropped the thing? Yeah, the human world What? What? What a nice surprise! I wasn't expecting you home so early Yeah Hi mom, it's because... Oh, the results of the nationwide exams I've been waiting all day Here Goodness! Number one again! These are the highest scores you've had Yeah, I guess, I'm going to study in my room so please don't interrupt me, okay? As you wish Oh, light! Do you want anything at all, dear? You can ask for whatever you like No, I'm fine, mom. Thanks, though I've already got what I want I'm sorry, mom I'm sorry, mom I'm sorry, mom I'm sorry, mom I'm sorry, mom I'm sorry, mom I'm sorry, mom You've taken quite a liking to it No reason to act surprised I am the Shinigami Ryuk That used to be my notebook Judging by your laughter, you've already figured out that what you have is no ordinary notebook Shinigami... I've got a death, huh? Well, I'm not surprised In fact, Ryuk I've been waiting for you Oh? I've already figured out that this death note I found is real It didn't take me long And now that I've witnessed the proof of its power, I only feel more confident what I'm going to do That's interesting I certainly wasn't expecting this Several death notes have made their way into the human world in the past But you're the first to have written this many names Look at how many people you've killed in only five days Most are reluctant to write this much I've already prepared myself for Ryuk I used the notebook even though I knew it belonged to a Shinigami And now that Shinigami has come So what'll happen to me? You're here to take my soul, right? Huh? What do you mean? Is that some fantasy you humans came up with? I'm not going to do anything to you Ah... The notebook becomes part of the human realm from the very moment it touches the earth In other words, the notebook is now yours This is mine If you don't want it, just give it to someone else But if you give it away, I'd have no choice but to erase your memories of the notebook So then, you're saying I can use the death note all I want and I won't be punished? Let's just say this You will feel the fear and pain no-one only to humans who've used the notebook And when it's your time to die, it will fall on me to write your name in my death note Be warned, any human who's used a death note can either go to heaven or hell for eternity That's all Ah... Now you have something to look forward to after you die Ah... Light? It'll be alright, answer it What is it? I thought you'd like some apples, the neighbors brought them over for us Why on earth is it so dark in your room? You're ruined your eyesight What's going on? Mom can't see him? That notebook you found originally belonged to me And since you're now using it, you are the only one who's able to see me And of course, my voice can only be heard by you In other words, the death note is the bond between light, the human, and Ryuk, the Shinigami Yeah, I just have one more question I want to ask you Why was I chosen for this? Hey, are you even listening? Ah... Apple's in the human world or worth the trip What's the best way to describe these? You see? Just answer my question I didn't choose you Don't you see this is all just an accident? You actually thought you were chosen because you're so smart or something? Don't be so vain It just happened to fall around here and you just happened to pick it up And that's all there is to it That's why I wrote the instructions in English The most popular language in the human world Then why did you drop it in the first place? You even wrote down specific instructions So don't try to tell me this was an accident You're asking me why? I did it because I was bored You were bored? The truth is, Shinigami haven't got much to do these days Most of the time we're either taking naps or gambling If you take the time to write names in your death note, the others just laugh at you for working so hard Even if you wrote the name of another Shinigami, it'd be pointless because they wouldn't die And since we live in the Shinigami realm, it brings us no amusement to kill those in the human world either So I figured I'd have more fun if I came down here myself Anyway, I'm surprised at how many names you've written But I want to know why you only wrote the cause of death for that guy who was hit by the truck If you don't write down the cause of death, the victim dies of a heart attack And that's probably the best thing about the death note, are you? Huh? You see, I've already exhausted the list of the world's major criminals And eventually I'm going to get rid of them all What's the point of doing that? It's only a matter of time before people figure out that these criminals are being eliminated by someone I want the world to know of my existence That there's someone out there passing righteous judgment on the wicked Why even bother? What are you trying to achieve by passing judgment on them? I mean, why do you care? Because I've been bored too I wasn't ready to believe it at first, but it's obvious now There's something about the death note itself that makes humans want to try it out at least once I killed them both I really, I killed two men Those were human lives It won't be overlooked Besides, who might have passed judgment on others? No, no wait, maybe I'm wrong This is exactly what I've been thinking about lately This world is rotting and those who are making it rot deserve to die Someone has to do it, so why not me? Even if it means sacrificing my own mind and soul, it's worth it Because the world can't go on like this I wonder, what if someone else had picked up this notebook? Is there anyone out there other than me who'd be willing to eliminate the vermin from the world? If I don't do it, then who will? That's just it, there's no one But I can do it In fact, I'm the only one who can I'll do it As in the death note, I'll change the world No! No! At first I wrote the names of the worst criminals I could think of Like I was cleaning up the world one name at a time So that eventually no one will ever do anything evil again And while the truly guilty ones who deserve to be punished for their crimes die of heart attacks The people who are less guilty but who still make trouble for others will slowly be erased through disease and accidental death Then, and only then the world will start moving in the right direction It'll be a new world free of injustice and populated by people who I've judged to be honest, kind and hardworking But if you did that, it would make you the only bad person left Huh? I have no idea what you're talking about I'm a hardworking honor student who's considered to be one of Japan's best and brightest And I... I will become the God of this new world It's just as I thought humans are so interesting I believe in myself And I'll get along with me Now that I have chosen a tool And I hope this world will also be \ub418\uc9c0 In the future I will be forgotten Because of the terrible\u2070\u304d\u3063\u3068 \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u304c \u541b\u5f7c\u3089\u3067\u3082 Spirit \u5f7c\u3089\u3067\u3082 \u5f7c\u3089\u3067\u3082 \u5f7c\u3089\u3067\u3082 \u3053\u3053\u306b\u3067\u3059\u5168ony\u3084\u3081...",
        "translated": "Dreams, dreams, see them, change them, everyone, hope, the end spreads in the darkness, shadows, taught each other, customers, earthquakes, no one will disturb anyone, like, necessary, someday, I'll show you, come, no need to come, look at the world, look at the world, look at the world, look at the world, the whole station is playing, darce, photo, house, live, Digens, ne, ah, covering, 3acking, I can't say anything about the battle and the left, so Popobo should want to link, Harutake should not have fought a hard victory, Ara, by the work, we shook the voice of the use, Noaukinko Furujia was arrested in the district of Shibuya Tokyo, He is being held in custody facing murder charges for the brutal slang of this common law parker who was only 25 at the time of her death Day in and day out The same news on permanent repeat This is all so ridiculous This world is rotting Another noticeable consequence is the extinction of many species of the planet species are now becoming extinct at a faster rate than has ever occurred in a record of historyDarth node has in a notebook of death? How do you use it? A human whose name is written in the book of death? How do you use it? A human whose name is written in this notebook shall die That's pretty lame, not to mention it twisted It's really not that different from one of those chain letters you get A human whose name is written in this notebook shall die? Come on There must be something wrong with me to even consider it This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person 's face in their mind when writing his or her name Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next six minutes and 40 seconds So depending on the person you have in mind, you can either kill them easily or painfully This is pretty detailed for a prank, I'll give them that So I write a name in that person dies Like anyone would believe that Wait, on the off chance someone really dies, would that make me a murderer? Yeah right, it's completely impossible The same as Salin who attacks six people at a busy shopping district in Shinjuku yesterday has struck again Taking eight people hostage at this daycare center, his captives include both children and teachers The police have now identified the suspect as 42-year-old Kuro Oto Harada, currently absent We expect negotiations to begin immediately A heart attack in 40 seconds, we'll see At the present time, that's all the police are telling us You can't yell but feel concerned for the absolutely of those hostages You're right, we'll continue to monitor the situation from here Thank you for that report, what do you make of this Mr. Hashimoto? Well, one can only hope for a quick resolution to this situation Looks like the notebook doesn't work Oh well, I didn't expect it to anyway Wait, we're seeing something here, looks like movement at the front entrance The hostages are coming out, and they all look to be unharmed The special forces are taking action, they're moving in We don't know if the suspect's been arrested Huh? Yes? Okay, we now have confirmation The suspect has been found dead inside I repeat, the suspect is now dead Dead? to be a coincidence Bye It's already 6.30 you know, don't you have cramps, cool tonight? Yeah, I'll be ready in just a sec Death note It's unlikely, but if by chance this thing is for real I have to test it one more time, in which case it should probably be another criminal But if he's too well known, that'll be a problem If he dies, there's a good possibility that news of his death will be covered up I need to see results right away Hey, real buddy What is it, Sudou? Didn't you want to land me $20? Huh? Again? But I can't do that Sudou, maybe I should try killing him No, I should definitely avoid killing people I know And again, does it even really matter? I mean, would anyone really care if a guy like him was to disappear one day? Sweet, looks like we'll be hanging at the arcade after school How can you speak dating party tomorrow? You wanna come? Yeah, of course Oh, there's no way I'm missing that Damn it, why is my mom so useless?

        "original": " Once upon a time you see, in a strange lamp not far away, I met the chance a little bit upon a most unusual day. And when I asked who she was, she told me by her, No one we could ever be like by her, by your wife question me. Why is no one so far away? My, my, she's always in a pretty pickle my eye, Helping someone else's little my eye, My, everyone was my eye, my eye, my eye, My, our containers what you see. That's the thing for me. I can't catch my eye, I can't catch this yet. Hey, all careful, please, what are you doing? Hang on a sec. Hang on a sec. There's Alexander. Wow, how are you, Alexander? So, so, I guess. Oh, I see you have another piece of cheese. Yes, then you can smell how good it is. Well, I must be going. Goodness, what a painful business. Thank you, everything has seen such an effort. I hope he's not sick, he's not getting any younger. Oh, Mr. Turtle, how are you? Oh, it's you, Maya. Hello, I'm fine, thanks. Hello, Maya, isn't it a beautiful day? Yes, Flip, it's lovely. Well, I'm coming, I'm coming. Here you are. How is close? I'm glad I could help you. Without your help, I would surely have drowned. I was very big, Jonathan. I think so, I've always managed them before. I wonder if I'm getting old. It could be arthritis. Oh, these old bones, they don't work well anymore. Hello, Frida. I've been looking for you everywhere. And last night, I was wondering what you mean, Maya. What's that, I see? Buck and Maya. Hey, hey, hey. Yes? What's this all about? Huh? Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Oh, forgive me, my darling, I was getting worse and worse. I mixed you up with Maya. I know that you're a short sighted, but don't do something hideous to me. No, really. Oh, Frida, please, there's no reason to start crying. You know, I'm very nearly lost my life today through my short sightedness. I only just managed to escape. The fly-sorto missed me by a hare's breath. Oh, that's been my nightmare for years. Just think when he's usually so far. Oh! Oh! I've got the feeling my hearing is getting worse. I can't hear the high notes at all anymore. Terrible, that's... You've been in a huge loss, you're out of tune. He's just what could be worse than a violent vertuous who suddenly loses my hearing. One of them can't jump, and the others are losing their sight and hearing. Just wait, you dear. No, no, no! Just wait, then. No, first you must tell me what you want. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. I'll tell you something, my darling, you must stop chasing me like this. My heart won't take it. Strange, I'm also completely out of breath. Oh dear, I hope it's not old age creeping up on us, Kurt. I fear it may be, for weeks now when I work, I feel a stabbing here in my shoulder. Oh dear! The surge, my shoulder, for me, it bits. Yes, of course. It's a nut I'll make a good herb to you for the two. Ah, that was nice. Come on, dude, for you too. You do that well. Ah, seems as if everybody's sick. Oh, no, ring comes, oh, I can't believe it! I won't believe it! Mother, what's the matter? Mommy's mother... You took on your daughter so much! Don't... Ooooh, no way! I'll factors away all myself this time. Damn! I must ask her again, perhaps she's really sick. Please tell me, don't you feel very well? What? Oh! Oh, I'm just putting on my beauty, Marska. Sorry, I hope I didn't frighten you. You're doing well. I'm alright, discovered wrinkles on my face. This is a mixture of honey and sunflower seed oil. That'll get rid of wrinkles? Of course it will. It's a famous old remedy. Explain to me, do wrinkles hurt you? What a silly question. When you've given your life to beauties I have, they can hurt you most terribly. How would you like to try them? Oh, I didn't know. Oh yes, I had the same confidence as you have just a couple of years ago. But you lose that as soon as you lose your beauty, believe me. It's really nice to only... Suddenly all my friends are worried at the beginning to get old. You like and see it. They can't do the things they used to be able to do. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Hey, hey, hey. Oh, look, look, hey! Oh, look, look, look, look. I don't mind. I don't mind. Wake up. What's the matter? We are going to go visit Alexander today. But who are you? Are you so old that you guys can't even tell who your best friends are anymore? I'm flippe, of course. And today we're going to go to see Alexander. Oh yes, that's right. Not so fast, but I can't fly as well as I could. What do you mean for someone your age is still flying extremely well here? It's easy if we help each other. Here it is. What do you want? Oh, it's flipped if I'm not mistaken. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What's that? Who did you buy, said, quite right? Ah, ah. And who is this we've got here? Madam Butterfly, how nice of you to read. Who do you like another cup of tea? There they are. I can't understand how in my young days I didn't like to eat cheese at all. Just so as I choose it, the young people are. Please don't feel a play. You nice and soft, just nice like poor old teeth. By the way, Mr. Beckler wouldn't you like to play a little something for us as well? Respectler. And you poor old exandie can't see very well here, very well anymore, only eat cheese. Oh, my over there. My over. Of course, now I remember my over can't play anymore because she's got room. Of course, it's explaining to him. We all of us know that we're getting old, but he's totally gaga. Well, I said, you want some gorgonzola? Why don't have any in this misgloss until the autumn festival? I'm not going to do this to eating it all right, good. It's such a pity about poor old Alexander, we're still a couple of spring chickens compared to him. When's it for the time? That's how all fairytales start. Where are the days when we were still young? I, uh, now be careful not to strain yourself. You're old enough. Oh, as long as I can still fly, Flip. Life is not so bad. Oh, oh, oh, I can't stay up. I'm dropping lower and lower. Oh! Why don't you watch out, you're blocking the road. You could at least apologize to why you anyway. I don't recognize. What's that? You don't know us anymore? You're a very strange. It's true, but sure you should recognize us. You're the three lady bird children. Can you really not remember us, Maya? Yes, I do. Well, sort of. Think back. Well, of course, now I remember you must be the three lady bird children. But goodness, you're so big. Well, we're old enough, aren't we? We've grown big and you've grown old. That's your difference. Now, you listen to me. Even if you have grown up, you've still got absolutely no right to call me an old being. Do you understand? Oh, that's how I remember her. She was always fighting. She's very old. You're gonna put her down now. Have a look at the water. Can you see what an old bag of bones you've turned into? Oh, no, no, no. What's going on? How can you be so small? You were a giant. At least twice as tall as I am. Let's see if we can wake her up. Whether you're bigger or smaller, you're always causing trouble. Oh, I dreamed that. Good, I was right. It was just a nasty dream. I'm not an old being. And I can still fly perfectly. My wings are as good as ever. Oh, my old one, I like the dogs. Yes. I'm so glad that was a dream. I can fly as well as ever and that's never going to change. And that I know for absolutely certain. At least I don't notice my getting old. Oh, oh, Doctor Snail. I see you're in good mood as usual. Oh, yes. But please excuse me. I'm not going to be late. I'm not going to be late. I'm not going to be late. I'm not going to be late. You're in good mood as usual. Oh, yes. But please excuse me for sitting on your house. That's all right. I was just having a good think about something that's been bothering me a lot. So I went into my shell. I'm worried about the health of our insects. Doctor Snail, Doctor Snail. We're calling Doctor Snail. Yes, Snail, Doctor Snail. And it's one of the greatest stuff in the Great Miss Fortun. Oh, please, Doctor Snail. Won't you go and see him? Careful, girl. He's rolling down. Have a good treat. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Why do I always have a dream? There's no time for foolishness. Ah. Alexander, what's the matter? It happened when I wanted to pick up my cheese. And all of a sudden I experienced a terrible pain in my hip. Possibly a hernia. I lift him up carefully and put him down over there. Hopefully we won't have to operate on you if we're lucky that is. You believe it? He picks up a piece of cheese and gives himself a hernia. I'll have to do a thorough examination. You remember what I was saying, Maya? For some time now, I've been scratching my head about the health of a lot of insects around here. Why not examine everyone? I'll go and call them. Very good. We will take it upon ourselves to instruct everybody to come here. Today's examinations have borne out what I suspected, which is that the physical condition of most of you leads a lot to be desired. If you don't do something about it, you will all end up as old crocs. You see, that's where the pain in your shoulder comes from. That's where I could be old already. It's terrible, everyone. As from today and three times a day, you will all do physical exercises to slow down the process of growing old. As you know, physical exercises are the best way to do that. That's a good idea. I'll begin with some stomach exercises so that I can eat much more pollen. You'll definitely come to a bad end. If you carry on like that one day, you fall out of the air because your wings won't be a supporter. I hope that'll make you think, will you? To tell the truth, it won't. It'll still be a long time before I'm too heavy to fly. That's no reason for not doing a bit of training. I won't have to train, will I? Oh, yes, you will. It's never too early to start my dear Maya. I think you're right. When I think of what happened, perhaps I've become too fat and slow to get out of the way anytime. We'll start right away with the exercises, an easy one to begin with. First, we run as fast as we can, and then, every four or five steps, we jump into the air like rabbits. Any question? That sounds too terrible. Do you think we are managed? I'm practicing my web. Run and jump, must we? Ah! No, don't do it. Don't do it too difficult. All right, then, forget it. And in a few months, you'll all be crippled and lame. Help! Help! A fire! Fire! Somebody's house is the fire! It's the fire! Look, you can see the smoke. Oh, tell you where the fire is. Alexander, it's your own house that's going up in flames. What? I'm saying, my house will fire! My house will fire! Don't do the cocktail! In your training today, we was going to put Alexander's fire out. That is good training. I don't know if I'll be able to help with my body how to condition like this. There's not some of your silly jokes, but there's no time for that. Everybody don't discreet and fill buckets. Make a lot of chate Alexander's house for the last of a long. I'm really sorry. It's my fault. It's terrible. Take it, take it, fire out. Fuck! It's not a good thing. It's not a good thing. Ugh! It's so cool! Oh! Oh my God! Such cases I'm very useful. My valuable staff! My precious staff! Oh, my God! This is a good opportunity to give a demonstration of my erratic flying. I went up to the ferry to the flames. Don't stop now, everyone! The fire's nearly out! I'm going to get the fire out! Yes sir! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I'm going to get the fire out! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Yes sir! The fire is out! Oh, my friends! How on earth am I going to die? Thank you for I supply it in spain any further. Anyone on his own would have been helpless against that inferno. It shows we should all stick together. I'm always here, always on duty. Anyone can ask me for help anytime. It's such a pity that the heat was the boob of my fire. And you don't show off like that. And how do you keep doing, if I may ask? Good heavens, it was hurting me so terribly and now I don't feel a single thing. No way! I'm healthy! I will find again. I'm in duck form. And why, hurrah? I don't think we need your physical exercises anymore. Doctor, I think the fire proved was wearing good condition and still feeling young. That's a high field. Yes, I don't think we have any need of those exercises. Yes, we don't have to hop around like rabbits. There you have it, Doctor Snail. Everyone's feeling well and in top condition. That's where you're wrong. We find this special strength only in emergencies. No, you must train. Now we're all going to run over to that corner there and back. So please, everyone, take your places. And start at once. But first, a small and tasty token of my appreciation. Oh! Oh! No, no, thanks. Thanks for the same good night. Oh! Sit your running, run as far as the big holly tree, then at least it'll do you well. Oh! Oh! I'm sure you'll agree, Doctor. There's nothing better than cheese to keep the body healthy. Ah, have a slice, dear friends. This is one of the most delicious for rye teas. Oh! Oh! Oh! Goodbye, Tee. You understand why nobody likes my cheese, Doctor Snail? No! Doctor, bye-hi! Oh, I never thought cheese would make me run. That cheese in the middle of the meta every day we'd see everybody run. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!",
        "translated": "Once upon a time you see, in a strange lamp not far away, I met the chance a little bit upon a most unusual day. And when I asked who she was, she told me by her, No one we could ever be like by her, by your wife question me. Why is no one so far away? My, my, she's always in a pretty pickle my eye, Helping someone else's little my eye, My, everyone was my eye, my eye, my eye, My, our containers what you see. That's the thing for me. I can't catch my eye, I can't catch this yet. Hey, all careful, please, what are you doing? Hang on a sec. Hang on a sec. There's Alexander. Wow, how are you, Alexander? So, so, I guess. Oh, I see you have another piece of cheese. Yes, then you can smell how good it is. Well, I must be going. Goodness, what a painful business. Thank you, everything has seen such an effort. I hope he's not sick, he's not getting any younger. Oh, Mr. Turtle, how are you? Oh, it's you, Maya. Hello, I'm fine, thanks. Hello, Maya, isn't it a beautiful day? Yes, Flip, it's lovely. Well, I'm coming, I'm coming. Here you are. How is close? I'm glad I could help you. Without your help, I would surely have drowned. I was very big, Jonathan. I think so, I've always managed them before. I wonder if I'm getting old. It could be arthritis. Oh, these old bones, they don't work well anymore. Hello, Frida. I've been looking for you everywhere. And last night, I was wondering what you mean, Maya. What's that, I see? Buck and Maya. Hey, hey, hey. Yes? What's this all about? Huh? Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Oh, forgive me, my darling, I was getting worse and worse. I mixed you up with Maya. I know that you're a short sighted, but don't do something hideous to me. No, really. Oh, Frida, please, there's no reason to start crying. You know, I'm very nearly lost my life today through my short sightedness. I only just managed to escape. The fly-sorto missed me by a hare's breath. Oh, that's been my nightmare for years. Just think when he's usually so far. Oh! Oh! I've got the feeling my hearing is getting worse. I can't hear the high notes at all anymore. Terrible, that's... You've been in a huge loss, you're out of tune. He's just what could be worse than a violent vertuous who suddenly loses my hearing. One of them can't jump, and the others are losing their sight and hearing. Just wait, you dear. No, no, no! Just wait, then. No, first you must tell me what you want. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. I'll tell you something, my darling, you must stop chasing me like this. My heart won't take it. Strange, I'm also completely out of breath. Oh dear, I hope it's not old age creeping up on us, Kurt. I fear it may be, for weeks now when I work, I feel a stabbing here in my shoulder. Oh dear! The surge, my shoulder, for me, it bits. Yes, of course. It's a nut I'll make a good herb to you for the two. Ah, that was nice. Come on, dude, for you too. You do that well. Ah, seems as if everybody's sick. Oh, no, ring comes, oh, I can't believe it! I won't believe it! Mother, what's the matter? Mommy's mother... You took on your daughter so much! Don't... Ooooh, no way! I'll factors away all myself this time. Damn! I must ask her again, perhaps she's really sick. Please tell me, don't you feel very well? What? Oh! Oh, I'm just putting on my beauty, Marska. Sorry, I hope I didn't frighten you. You're doing well. I'm alright, discovered wrinkles on my face. This is a mixture of honey and sunflower seed oil. That'll get rid of wrinkles? Of course it will. It's a famous old remedy. Explain to me, do wrinkles hurt you? What a silly question. When you've given your life to beauties I have, they can hurt you most terribly. How would you like to try them? Oh, I didn't know. Oh yes, I had the same confidence as you have just a couple of years ago. But you lose that as soon as you lose your beauty, believe me. It's really nice to only... Suddenly all my friends are worried at the beginning to get old. You like and see it. They can't do the things they used to be able to do. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Hey, hey, hey. Oh, look, look, hey! Oh, look, look, look, look. I don't mind. I don't mind. Wake up. What's the matter? We are going to go visit Alexander today. But who are you? Are you so old that you guys can't even tell who your best friends are anymore? I'm flippe, of course. And today we're going to go to see Alexander. Oh yes, that's right. Not so fast, but I can't fly as well as I could. What do you mean for someone your age is still flying extremely well here? It's easy if we help each other. Here it is. What do you want? Oh, it's flipped if I'm not mistaken. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What's that? Who did you buy, said, quite right? Ah, ah. And who is this we've got here? Madam Butterfly, how nice of you to read. Who do you like another cup of tea? There they are. I can't understand how in my young days I didn't like to eat cheese at all. Just so as I choose it, the young people are. Please don't feel a play. You nice and soft, just nice like poor old teeth. By the way, Mr. Beckler wouldn't you like to play a little something for us as well? Respectler. And you poor old exandie can't see very well here, very well anymore, only eat cheese. Oh, my over there. My over. Of course, now I remember my over can't play anymore because she's got room. Of course, it's explaining to him. We all of us know that we're getting old, but he's totally gaga. Well, I said, you want some gorgonzola? Why don't have any in this misgloss until the autumn festival? I'm not going to do this to eating it all right, good. It's such a pity about poor old Alexander, we're still a couple of spring chickens compared to him. When's it for the time? That's how all fairytales start. Where are the days when we were still young? I, uh, now be careful not to strain yourself. You're old enough. Oh, as long as I can still fly, Flip. Life is not so bad. Oh, oh, oh, I can't stay up. I'm dropping lower and lower. Oh! Why don't you watch out, you're blocking the road. You could at least apologize to why you anyway. I don't recognize. What's that? You don't know us anymore? You're a very strange. It's true, but sure you should recognize us. You're the three lady bird children. Can you really not remember us, Maya? Yes, I do. Well, sort of. Think back. Well, of course, now I remember you must be the three lady bird children. But goodness, you're so big. Well, we're old enough, aren't we? We've grown big and you've grown old. That's your difference. Now, you listen to me. Even if you have grown up, you've still got absolutely no right to call me an old being. Do you understand? Oh, that's how I remember her. She was always fighting. She's very old. You're gonna put her down now. Have a look at the water. Can you see what an old bag of bones you've turned into? Oh, no, no, no. What's going on? How can you be so small? You were a giant. At least twice as tall as I am. Let's see if we can wake her up. Whether you're bigger or smaller, you're always causing trouble. Oh, I dreamed that. Good, I was right. It was just a nasty dream. I'm not an old being. And I can still fly perfectly. My wings are as good as ever. Oh, my old one, I like the dogs. Yes. I'm so glad that was a dream. I can fly as well as ever and that's never going to change. And that I know for absolutely certain. At least I don't notice my getting old. Oh, oh, Doctor Snail. I see you're in good mood as usual. Oh, yes. But please excuse me. I'm not going to be late. I'm not going to be late. I'm not going to be late. I'm not going to be late. You're in good mood as usual. Oh, yes. But please excuse me for sitting on your house. That's all right. I was just having a good think about something that's been bothering me a lot. So I went into my shell.

No hurry, no hurry What are you talking about? What are you talking about? We're going to talk What are you talking about? Oh my, my! Help! Mine is next, J\u00faday! Help! Juday is coming, huh? What's wrong with you? Ah! Oh, oh! Tanda Maia, come with me. What are you doing? I'm doing the same thing, I'm flapping my wings. Oh, why? Are you sick? No, it's nothing. Life is too much for the bees and with Maia, who is too much for you, Maia. We are creating a chain, giving. Ah! When it's too hot, the net will be loose, if the eggs die, we have to save them. Maia, what are you doing? You don't know if you shouldn't get sick, Silly. I know, but when I feel like I'm in the mood, I know! Oh! Good, they're working again. They must be crazy, the little hole, where I sleep at night, is never too much. They shouldn't have built a Maia house with so many rooms. Ah! Ah, ah! They're playing for the children. Let me warn you that it is our enemies who are always waiting to catch us in the dark. That is why the bees cannot leave the Maia color at night. They did not want that. What is it, Maia? How long can we go outside and fly? He said that it was almost time. That is always there to have me, but he never takes us. What a whiner! I will take as many as will come at the right time. And how many will that be? Well, let's take as many as it will be. And how about this afternoon? PAAAAA! PAAAAA! PAAAAA! Maia will learn to fly. Maia will learn to fly. I will learn to fly. I will learn to fly. For? Who? Me. You are not little Willy. You do not know if I am Maia. Excuse me, the person wants the Willys. Hmm... Maia, you have to go over there. I look like Willy. No, I don't think so. Go over there. Okay. So who did you decide to come with? Why did you come back? Excuse me. I have to tell everyone. It's a very special day in my life. I even have wings. Look how shiny it is. Come on, guys, let's start. Meeeee! Meeeee! The first time is a little difficult. Maia, do you want to try? Yes! Aha ... Never mind, Willy. Do you want me to tell you a nice story? I'm sure you knew I was embarrassed to make a fool of myself when I tried to fly. I'm ex-friend! She's very cool, she's really my friend. Well, look, the little shelters are learning to fly. I don't see a little Maia there, do they misbehave and not let it show? Try asking Professor Cassandra. The pimps don't have to learn to fly, we're very intelligent, Maia must have misbehaved. Okay? What a lack of authority, only giving the minutes when talking to the lady. You don't understand, I have to get rich and I jump because I'm happy. What did the little Maia do this time? I know she's very fussy, she always has no problems with me, but what was going to happen? Just a little more soup. No, no. Try to be strong? Enough, I'll come back. Talked, do everything right, Willy. Try to eat everything, open your mouth. Maia, I can't. What's wrong with you, Willy? What happened? It's together, but I'll come back. But what do you get out of the soup? Maia said I didn't have the strength and made me eat all that. Maia. Cherta so well here. It's the flowers. They're so beautiful. A la flower. Maia, Maia, where are you? I'm here, Professor Cassandra. I'm on my way. La la, don't be bad. It came out, it came out. Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch. I'm hurting a bud. Ouch, that bud is honey, it'll be good. Bud of the head with a pot of honey. It wasn't on purpose. I hope it wasn't. A la, potia, what's here in the house? Careful, I'm going to come in with my pot. I'm going to try it. Oh, police! I'm going to collect a lot so I can be the pot. Chairo, so good. Oh, I'm so heavy. I'm so sure that I've had enough. I think I'm going home. Oh! Nobody told me that the treadmill is so heavy. I'm going to have to stop a lot to tire you out. Oh! You're a bunch of jerks, we don't live together. The first time my mother is out of action. Why do you know about me? Who am I? Here I am. I've wanted to meet you for a long time. I'm not afraid of myself. I'm Flip, the grasshopper, and I want to be your friend. I know a lot about you. So, seriously. Up here. Where are you? I can't stay still in the same place. And what do you know about me? I've known you since you were a little bee inside the hive. Have you been peeing at me since you were a baby? Yes. It's very irritating to talk to you. You really have to be bold and quick with you. Yes, I'm like that. Don't rest, grasshopper! If I'm not tall, I wouldn't even start going. I wouldn't have anything to do. I like to watch, Maya. You make me laugh. And I want to help you when you're in trouble. You're very calm. And you're always devastated by problems. You're curious. Goodbye, Maya! I spoke! I spoke! I spoke! I spoke! I spoke! I spoke! What a mess! My yard doesn't have time and my cleaning master! Very good! Today you learned to recognize me. Damn it! You didn't eat enough like Maia, and that's why yours might be Russian! You can't learn everyone and Cac\u00e2ndara's concession must have already known that. He said that yours might still be filling. Ahahahah! You can't learn everyone and the concession must have already known that the teacher was tired. Rome and Pavia weren't built just in a day because people have to rest. Hi, just be careful. When you joke, be very careful with spiders and their webs. They are our worst enemy. Oh, no! Where is Maya? She's over there, singing teacher. No, the nest has a judge. Look how nice the flowers are. Maya, Maya from here. Ahahahahahah! Ahahahah! I'm here, singing teacher. Be careful. Maya! I'm dividing to have direction, Maya! Maya! Ahahahah! That's to have exploded with the little webs, but I think in my view. Maya! Mobo already has the idiot #1 YO's names! William Wilson ThinkBestr, golvina water. Without a doubt. Maya! Thanks for Sally. Oui! SurendPac! What a fool, Maia! I'm flippe! The prince's narcissus is correct! What does that mean? Don't visit the queen's web! Where is it, huh? Ask Cassandra! Ahahahah! Oh! Oh! Ahahahah! Ahahahah! Ahahahah! Ahahahah! Ahahahah! What a defense, strange one! What are you talking about? Maia! We're finally home! Ah! I didn't spill the honey! Ahahahah! Careful! Ahahahah! Come in, you slacker! Now there's nothing! I won't let you be king yesterday! Come in, I'll see my pot! Ahahahah! Aaah!! Ahahahah! What happened? I can't move my wings, they're so stuck. Profitaira Cassandra, where are you? I'm in trouble, help me! Profitaira Cassandra, where are you? Come help me, please! What am I going to do with the speech-being? I'm going to be completely alone in the middle of the forest and I can't fly! What's going on? Why are you so sad? Flip, I am! All women have wings. I'll only give them a ride on my back. But I might fall! Hold on? Back to the mengrens-rebounds, ready, One, two, three, here we go! But president, the article! It's much better than goar, just the password! Ahahahah!!! The station must be old by now! I also think you're right! Professor Cassandra will grow up seeing where little Maia was. What will he say? I'm sorry, but I can't help you. I have to go. Goodbye, little Maia! There? There? There? Little Maia never misses a daydream. What she likes most is to daydream near the blue sky, free from salt. The next episode will be very exciting, but I won't tell you why. Why? I'll just tell you that it will be really fun. You'll see. Goodbye, until next time!"

Sou um gafanhoto O meu nome \u00e9 Felipe, espero que gostem de mim Eu sei que sou esquisito mas onde habituar-se vem c\u00e1 muitas vezes N\u00e3o sei que eu estarei a que vos \u00e9 de contar A gente ainda n\u00e3o me \u00e9 confusionada de interessante Parece que a vida de gafanhoto pode ser muito em fadonha. Passar o dia com a herve e assaltitar do lado para o outro n\u00e3o \u00e9 l\u00e1 muito chitante, embora eu gosto de comer. Gustava que a burbleta fosse minha amiga. \u00c9 na v\u00eam um insame de beilhas. Trazem-me-l. S\u00e3o t\u00e3o trabalhadoras aquelas pequeninas que as que at\u00e9 trabalham demais. Vou sempre ensame-nos. H\u00e1 l\u00e1! Porque eu era muito belo hoje de uma gotinha. Ah, \u00e9 mesmo delas, sempre ocupadas o dia inteiro. Nem se quer ter tempo para dizer-o l\u00e1, aqui \u00e9 tip\u00e1ticas. At\u00e9 deixa-te a ir o chap\u00e9u. Porque ser\u00e1 que voltaram t\u00e3o cedo? Que estou num demorar-se muito mais tempo, mas por que? O que ser\u00e1 acontecer? Este boreboren n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada vulgar. Talvez t\u00ednhamos sorte e aconte\u00e7a alguma coisa interessante. Ol\u00e1, minha oquinha. Faz dar o passeio. Ser\u00e1 que sabes falar? N\u00e3o, n\u00e3o me parece que saiba falar. E ainda \u00e9 muito nova. A \u00fanica coisa que sabe fazer \u00e9 abrir a boca. At\u00e9 eu estar com fome. J\u00e1 sei, deve haver problemas na colmeia. Fica do outro lado do castelo em ru\u00ednas. Por tr\u00e1s daquele grande penheiro. \u00c9 um lugar seguro e agrad\u00e1vel. O que \u00e9 que se passa? Por que n\u00e3o me deixes entrar? N\u00e3o sabe se quem eu sou. Se a segura n\u00e3o sabe a sangue, n\u00e3o pode entrar. N\u00e3o preciso de sangue a sua cassandra. Foi a sua professora quando andava na escola. O hoje \u00e9 o grande dia do nascimento. Se n\u00e3o me deixarem entrar, todas as ablinhas morrer\u00e3o. Olhem bem para as pessoas antes de dizer em que n\u00e3o as conhecem. Temos muito a pena, mas temos regras a cumprir. H\u00e1 muita gente que tenta entrar para armar confus\u00e3o. E n\u00f3s a que somos respons\u00e1veis. Deve um ter bom senso suficiente para mudar as regras no momento t\u00e3o importante como este. Nunca para esprepen\u00e7ar meu tolo. Se n\u00f3s soubessemos que era assim t\u00e3o importante. E agora j\u00e1 posso entrar? Ah, se a cassandra \u00e9 para onde voar-la para dentro. Finalmente. H\u00e1 muito tempo que estamos a esperar, devem estar quase a jocar. A\u00ed vem elas, vamos. N\u00e3o saiam daqui. N\u00e3o saiam daqui. N\u00e3o saiam daqui. N\u00e3o saiam daqui.

Ser\u00e1 que \u00e9 para que alguma porta? \u00c9 a Maya. Vou ter de romper. Ol\u00e1, est\u00e1 algu\u00e9m em casa? Sim, Maya. Temos estado aqui \u00e0 tua espera. Fusta a \u00faltima na sira. Quem \u00e9 a Maya? Sou a Maya. Por que que me chamou a Maya? Tiga-me para favor. Ah... Bem, na verdade, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 nenhuma raz\u00e3o especial. Toda a gente tem o nome. Ah... A senhora tamb\u00e9m tem o nome? Sim, chamo Cassandra. Tomo conta de voc\u00eas at\u00e9 serem grandes. Vem c\u00e1. \u00c9 ainda bem que me confio de estar calor. A culpa \u00e9 a tua. As outras j\u00e1 sa\u00edram h\u00e1 muito tempo. Por que que morar este tanto? Tive um sonho lindo. Um sonho? Mas Maya trabalha no cassonho. Talvez um dia ele contou meu sonho foi t\u00e3o divertido. Bom, eu s\u00f3 estou a adorar Cassandra. Vem c\u00e1, buscar. Espere, eu vou buscar-te. Calma. Ah, bem. A tua vida est\u00e1 apenas a come\u00e7ar e h\u00e1 tanta coisa para aprender. O que elas est\u00e3o a fazer? Est\u00e3o a aprender a viver e a chama. E a chama? O que \u00e9 isso? As abelhas v\u00e3o sempre a enxame. Por que? \u00c9 um bocadinho dif\u00edcil de perceber primeiro, vou ensinar de coisas mais f\u00e1ceis. Por que elas fazem isso? N\u00f3s as abelhas fazemos isto desde que existimos. E por que as abelhas fazem isso? Por que que nome de esprevesora Cassandra? Quer saber por que? Como \u00e9 que vou aprender alguma coisa sobre a vida? Se a senhora n\u00e3o me explica. Se apaciente, Maya, n\u00e3o posso explicar tudo de uma vez. Vamos ter com as outras. E dentro dos favos colocam-se os ovos. E por que fazem isso? Os ovos ficam dentro de favos e passadas algumas semanas na arte m\u00e1bilinha, como aconteceu contigo. Estive-no ovo com aquelas? Essi besta. Ve como elas colocam o ovo em cada buraquinho. Depois v\u00eam outra abelha que faz o barificio com a sera. S\u00f3 as obreiras s\u00f3 trabalham dentro da comemeia. S\u00f3 elas que constram em a comemeia e tomam conta dos ovos. Tenham sempre muito que fazer, pois todos os dias abem e amestream comem um grande n\u00famero de ovos. N\u00e3o parece que tlembros de como era quando estabas dentro do ovo, pois n\u00e3o. Onde \u00e9 que ser\u00e1 aquela me usa? \u00c9 pesado. Ah, \u00e9... Acasquim! Ah, est\u00e1s a\u00ed! Est\u00e1 a afir professor a Cassandra tamb\u00e9m consigo. \u00d3timo, mas \u00e9 s\u00f3 um ovo por cada buraquinho. Mas por que? Se os ovos ficassem aos pares, podiam falar-nos com os outros. Assim j\u00e1 n\u00e3o sentiam-se aos \u00ednios. Maia, n\u00f3s as abelhas n\u00e3o nascemos para conversar, nascemos para trabalhar. Estou muito preocupada com o tico, tem umas ideias muito estranhas nessa cabecinha. Eu gosto de minha ideia, dois ovos em vez de um. Minha crida, Maia, experi\u00eancia prova que \u00e9 melhor um ovo. Mas diga-l\u00e1 porque \u00e9 melhor. Fazimos divis\u00f5es maiores para mais ovos. Anda, vamos l\u00e1. Ah, que bem que cheira! Que fome! E \u00e9 mesmo bom o cheiro que est\u00e1s a sentir \u00e9 do mel. E \u00e9 mesmo bom o que voc\u00ea est\u00e1 fazendo. E \u00e9 mesmo bom o que voc\u00ea est\u00e1 fazendo.

I'm going to stay much longer, but why? What could happen? This boreboren is not at all ordinary. Maybe we'll be lucky and something interesting will happen. Hello, my little owl. Take a walk. Do you know how to talk? No, I don't think you can talk. And you're still very young. The only thing you know how to do is open your mouth. Until I'm hungry. I know, there must be trouble in the hive. It's on the other side of the ruined castle. Behind that big rock. It's a safe and pleasant place. What's going on? Why don't you let me in? You don't know who I am. If the safe doesn't taste like blood, you can't come in. I don't need your Cassandra's blood. She was your teacher when you were in school. Today is the big day of my birth. If you don't let me in, all the little ones will die. Look at people carefully before you say you don't know them. We are very sorry, but we have rules to follow. There are many people who try to get in to cause trouble. And we are the ones who are responsible. Someone should have enough common sense to change the rules at a time as important as this. Never to make fun of you, my fool. If we had known it was so important. And now can I get in? Oh, if Cassandra is where to fly her in. Finally. We have been waiting for a long time, they must be almost ready to play. Here they come, come on. Don't leave here. Don't leave here. Don't leave here. Don't leave here. Don't leave here. Don't leave here. Don't leave here. Don't leave here. Don't leave here. Don't leave here. How do I get out of here? Is there a door to it? It's Maya. I'm going to have to break up. Hello, is anyone home? Yes, Maya. We've been waiting for you here. The last one in the house. Who's Maya? I'm Maya. Why did you call me Maya? Call me as a favor. Oh... Well, actually, there's no special reason. Everyone has a name. Oh... Do you have a name too? Yes, my name is Cassandra. I'll take care of you until you grow up. Come here. It's a good thing I trust it's hot. It's your fault. The others left a long time ago. Why live so long? I had a beautiful dream. A dream? But Maya works in the dream house. Maybe one day he'll tell you my dream was so much fun. Well, I'm just loving Cassandra. Come here, get it. Wait, I'll get you. Calm down. Oh, well. Your life is just beginning and there's so much to learn. What are they doing? They're learning to live and the flame. And the flame? What is it? Bees always swarm. Why? It's a little hard to understand first, I'll teach you some easier things. Why do they do that? We bees have been doing this since we existed. And why do bees do that? Why do you call them Cassandra? Do you want to know why? How am I supposed to learn anything about life? If you Don't explain it to me. Be patient, Maya, I can't explain it all at once. Let's go to the others. And inside the combs, the eggs are laid. And why do they do that? The eggs stay inside the combs and after a few weeks in the little hole, like what happened to you. Have you been in the egg with those? That's stupid. See how they lay the egg in each little hole. Then another bee comes along and does the work with the bee. Only the workers only work inside the comb. Only they build the comb and take care of the eggs. They always have a lot to do, because every day they eat and feed a large number of eggs. It doesn't seem like you remember what it was like when you were inside the egg, do you? Where could that be? It's heavy. Oh, yeah... Cassandra! Oh, there you are! Professor, Cassandra is saying the same thing to me. Great, but it's only one egg per little hole. But why? If the eggs were kept in pairs, they could talk to each other. That way they wouldn't feel isolated. Maia, we bees weren't born to talk, we were born to work. I'm very worried about the bee, he has some very strange ideas in his little head. I like my idea, two eggs instead of one. My friend, Maia, experience proves that one egg is better. But tell me why it's better. We make bigger divisions for more eggs. Come on, let's go. Oh, how good it smells! How hungry! And the smell you're smelling is really good, it's the honey. And what you're doing is really good ... And what you're doing is really good. And what you're doing is really good. And what you're doing is really good. And what you're doing is really good. And what you're doing is really good. And what you're doing is really good. And what you're doing is really good. Oh Oh I left it, I love it. You're picking on what you didn't know. You're picking on what you didn't know. Mom, come back here now! This is scary! It's the same old story. A thousand times they're good, but they're so boring that I can't smell them. Now that they're older, I'm going to take them on a trip to the outside world to see the sky. It turned out that Sandra can tell what the sky is, I wanted to know. Wait until we get there, then I'll explain everything, but don't think that the world out there is just fun, the little frogs can't go out there alone and understand you. The world out there is dangerous to understand as it is cruel to be very careful. If I know why Sandra and I haven't been in school for two years. Then you should know that this is a one-time thing so that even worse enemies, ten times bigger than us, be very careful with them. Don't be afraid, go back to your legible voices. There is no place for the teeth of the comemeia, they can't get in, so you don't need to be afraid at all, my little ones. This is a frog... It never flies very low over the water. If not, this is what can happen. It has a very long tongue. Don't worry and the frogs will never be able to get in here. Oh, teacher Cassandra. Does that mean we should never go near the frogs? Don't forget your sauce. You are the H\u00edly. Yes, I am H\u00edly. For this being very clever. No, I haven't been there for two years. Well, I'm Maya. I've heard that about me. Yes, but it's just a matter of asking people so many questions that they're already screaming again. The world can be very cruel. For example, when it rains it's not at all pleasant. When that happens, go home, the hungry will be the worst. For what a bird can do. Do you want to find your answer, H\u00edly? Well, we had to stay home. What would happen if we didn't stay home, professor? I'm the one who's going to tell you, My dear. What's that noise? Please, don't move from your seats and I'll be right back. What's going on? There must be something wrong. Maya, Maya, where are you going? Come back here. Go back out? No, Maya. Maya, come back. It's not safe out there. What are you? What are you doing? I'm there! I'm there! It's not mine! It's not mine! The recipe for the hunt! Everyone is going to see this, pot. Almost come here. Okay, not just my little one. Quilito, he's the oldest. See if you get excited sometime. Look, a fiesta! It's not just once for the series. That's a figure, but since I'm responsible, I'll show you something else. This is once. It's not really. And also for ligosas. I've seen a series, it was called Marta and it really was one. It is, isn't it? It's a lyon wind. It's a wind. The wind is so strong that it lingers outside. It's really not pleasant. Aren't you already? Teacher Cassandra says it was blue. I'm looking at myself. I'm looking at myself. I'm looking at myself. Yes, Teacher Cassandra! Mil\u00edmos, what are you doing? You should be sitting down and studying by now. Thank you, Willi. You can go back to your seat. Maya, can you tell me what this is? But where is she? Can anyone tell me where she is? Did anyone see her leave? Yes, teacher. I saw her leave. That's exactly where she went. To see the storm. Ah! But why did she want to be so naughty? She has to keep an eye on that girl all the time. The world is beautiful again. How funny is it that I drew green. How funny is it that I drew green. How funny is it that I drew green. How funny is it that I drew green. How funny is it that I drew green. How funny is it that I drew green. How funny is it that I drew green. How funny is it that I drew green. How funny is it that I drew green. How funny is it that I drew green. How funny is it that I drew green. Honey, can you tell me where she is? Did anyone see her leave? Did anyone see her leave? Did anyone see her leave? What are you doing? You should always be watching that girl. You should always be watching that girl. You should always be watching that girl. Did anyone see her leave? Like a celestial car, I'm always spinning. Spinning, always spinning. One, two and three with me is fun. So, you'll see when you come back. You do it trustingly, it's a gift. When we dance, the flowers that blow in the wind. They also bless me and dance with me. Sing with me, jump with me. Sing a fun game with me. Split and dance, jump with me. Go, cut, come, dance and laugh with me. One, two, three. Like a celestial car, I'm always spinning. Always spinning. Spinning. Come and see, it's fun. Very good, very good. Maia, Maia, where are you? Maia, where are you? Answer me promptly. It's Sandra, your teacher. Maia, where are you? Maia, Maia. Now everything you hear is gone. You always get into trouble. You've seen a little bee. If you're looking for that other life of mine, it's there. Let me stay there for a few minutes and see if I learn my lesson. Maia. The teacher, Cassandra. She should take advantage of the fact that you're locked up to sting you. You were very naughty, Maia. I'm going to have to punish you and send you to bed right now. Oh, but I didn't do anything wrong, I just wanted to watch the storm. It doesn't matter if you cause yourself a lot of trouble. Apologize. And don't go out to explore the world again. Okay? Apologize. Come on, stop being so clumsy and go to sleep. Because this guy is just naughty, just because he wants to see the world outside. Next time, you should be smarter and run away when no one is looking. He'll never find me."

Agora que j\u00e1 s\u00e3o mais crescidos, vou lev\u00e1-los numa viagem ao mundo exterior pra ver em o c\u00e9u. Professor Acassandra pode dizer-me que \u00e9 o c\u00e9u que estava de saber. Espera at\u00e9 l\u00e1 chegarmos depois, explique-te tudo, mas n\u00e3o pensas que o mundo l\u00e1 fora \u00e9 s\u00f3 divers\u00e3o. As abalhas pequenas n\u00e3o podem dar l\u00e1 fora s\u00f3zinho e perceber-se. O mundo l\u00e1 fora \u00e9 perigoso de ainda perceber como \u00e9 cruel de ter muito cuidado. Sim, eu sei por que o professor Acassandra. Eu j\u00e1 n\u00e3o estava h\u00e1 dois anos. Ent\u00e3o deve saber que isto \u00e9 uma vez, porque h\u00e1 inimigos ainda piores de \u00e0s vezes maiores do que n\u00f3s. Tenham muito cuidado com eles. N\u00e3o tenham medo, voltem para os voces lugares. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 vezes para os dentes da comaia. Elas n\u00e3o podem entrar, por isso n\u00e3o precisam de ter medo de nenhum, minhas pequenas. Isto \u00e9 uma ra. Nunca voa e muito baixo sobre a \u00e1gua. Se n\u00e3o, isto \u00e9 o que pode acontecer. Elas t\u00eam uma l\u00edngua muito comprida. N\u00e3o se preocupa e as reas nunca poder\u00e3o entrar aqui. Ah, professor Acassandra. Isso quer dizer que nunca nos devemos aproximar das reas? Isso mesmo, e ele n\u00e3o se esque\u00e7am. Tu \u00e9 o Willie. Sim, sou Willie. Parece ser muito esp\u00e9rito. N\u00e3o, eu j\u00e1 ando nesta aula h\u00e1 dois anos. Bem, eu sou a Maya. J\u00e1 ouvi isto falar de mim. Sim, mas s\u00f3 coisas terr\u00edveis. Faz tantas perguntas \u00e0s pessoas que j\u00e1 davontaram de gritar. O mundo pode ser muito cruel. Por exemplo, quando chove n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada agrad\u00e1vel. Quando isso acontecer, voltam para casa, os condos se debaste de uma fome. Se estiver a chover l\u00e1 fora, qual \u00e9 a melhor coisa que uma abalha pode fazer? Quer cheirar sua responder, Willie? Bem, tivemos ficar em casa. O que \u00e9 que aconteceria se n\u00e3o fic\u00e1smos em casa, professor? Eu queboi de vos dizer, querida. Que barulho \u00e9 este? Por favor, n\u00e3o saiam dos voces lugares e eu volto j\u00e1. O que \u00e9 que estar\u00e1 a acontecer? Deve haver algum problema. Maya, Maya, Maya, onde \u00e9 que vais? Volta! Volta aqui! Volar fora! N\u00e3o, Maya. Maya, volta! N\u00e3o \u00e9 seguro ir l\u00e1 para fora! Ah, por que est\u00e3o? Que som fazer? Ah, por que est\u00e3o? Que som fazer? \u00c9 meu! N\u00e3o \u00e9, n\u00e3o \u00e9! Am\u00e9m!

Eu j\u00e1 vi uma s\u00e9rie, chamava S Marta, e era mesmo uma. Ah, em sementira! N\u00e3o, n\u00e3o \u00e9? Isso \u00e9 um dentro do li\u00e3o. N\u00e3o \u00e9 n\u00e3o, n\u00e3o \u00e9?

N\u00e3o \u00e9 mesmo nada agrad\u00e1vel. O seu j\u00e1 n\u00e3o \u00e9 sou. A professora Cassandra disse que era sou. Apenas a ver a sua espalhada. Apenas a ver a sua espalhada.

Ah! Mas que crian\u00e7a t\u00e3o travessa tem de estar sempre a vigiar aquela rapariga? Um mundo est\u00e1 outra vez lindo. Ah, quem gra\u00e7ada que eu beche em verde?

Foste muito, Maro, a Tamaya. Vou ter de te castigar e de te mandar j\u00e1 para a cama. Mas eu n\u00e3o fiz nada de mal s\u00f3 querer ver a tempestada. N\u00e3o interessa causar-se de muitos problemas. Pessoal, desculpa. E n\u00e3o volte a sair para explorar o mundo. Est\u00e1 bem? Pessoal, desculpa. Vai, deixa de estar a\u00ed sucegada e vestor-me.

Hello friends, as you can see? I'm a grasshopper My name is Felipe, I hope you like me I know I'm weird, but where you get used to it you come here, often Ah, I don't know what I'll be telling you People still aren't conditioned to be interesting It seems that the life of a grasshopper can be very boring Spending the day eating grass and hopping from side to side isn't very funny, although I like to eat Ah... Gustava I wish the butterfly was my friend It's a bee's nest and a bee's nest Bring honey Those little ones are so hard-working that those who even work too much I'm always going to teach Hello Ah... They collected a lot of melons from a little drop Ah, that's just them, always busy all day long They don't even have time to say, look there, here it's typical They even want the sepel Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah... Why did they come back so soon? I'm not going to stay much longer But why? What could happen? This buzz is not at all common, maybe we'll get lucky and something interesting will happen Hello, my little owl Go for a walk Do you know how to talk? No, I don't think you can talk And you're still very young The only thing you know how to do is open your mouth, until you're hungry I know, there must be trouble in the hive It's on the other side of the ruined castle Behind that big rock It's a safe and pleasant place Hmm? Hmm? Ha-ha What's wrong? Why don't you let me in? You don't know who I am If this boy doesn't taste like blood, he can't come in I don't need blood Your Cassandra was in the voice of the teacher when I was in school Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh... Today is the big day of birth If they don't let me in All you little morr\u00e3os Take a good look at people before you say you don't know them We have a lot to be sorry for, but we have rules to follow The many people who try to come in to cause trouble And we are the ones who are responsible One should have enough common sense to change the rules At a moment as important as this Never to make fun of you, my fool If we knew it was so important And now I can come in Ah... If the bastard can fly in there Finally We've been waiting for a long time It must be almost time to play Here they come, let's go Don't get out of here How am I supposed to get out of here? Is it so I don't come in? Oh... Oh, it's Maya Photo erdojou a pere Hello, is anyone home? Yes, Maya, we've been waiting for you here Fusta last in sia Who is Maya? I'm Maya Why did you call me Maya? Tell me please Well, actually, there's no special reason Everyone has the name Ah... Do you have the name too? Yes, I call the cazadra I'll take care of you until you grow up Come here Come in well, I trust you, it's hot Blame yours, the others have been gone for a long time Why cure this much? I had a beautiful dream A dream, but Maya works never dream Maybe one day he'll tell my dream, it was so much fun Well, I'm just idle the cazadra, come here, fish Wait, I'll fish for you Calm down, well Your life is just beginning and there's so much to learn What are they doing? Are they learning to live in and I call And I call? What's that? Bees always go in and I call Why? It's a little difficult to understand, first I'll teach you some easier things: Why do they do that? We bees do this since we insist. And why do bees do that? Why do you call them that Sandra wants to know why? How am I going to learn anything about life if you don't explain it to me? If you're patient, Maya, I can't explain everything to you at once. Ah, let's go to the others Ah And inside the combs they lay the eggs And why do they do that? The eggs stay inside the combs and after a few weeks in Mabelinha's art like what happened to you Were you in the oven with those? You see how they put each little hole in the oven Then another bee comes and checks with the bee Only the workers who only work inside the comb Only they who embarrass the eat and take care of the eggs Always have a lot to do, because every day I eat and tame a large number of eggs I don't think you remember what it was like when you were inside the oven, do you Ah! Where could that be? Hmm Ah! It's heavy Ah! What? Ah, you're there Are you saying, teacher, Cassandra is also with you Ah, team, but it's only one egg for each little hole But why, if the eggs were in pairs, could we talk to each other? So you wouldn't feel so alone anymore Maia, we bees weren't born to talk, we were born to work I'm very worried about the tico, you have some very strange ideas in that little head I like an idea, two eggs instead of one My dear, Maia, experience proves that one egg is better But tell me why is it better? We made bigger divisions for more eggs? Oh, let's go Oh, how good it smells! How hungry! And it really is good the smell you're smelling is honey Why? Why me the bees? It got so... Tra\u00f1o! Okay... Because I can<|cy|> What do you guys think this is the superpower's pri\u00f1ado. You can scrape Nintendo through the infector. Leave it, it's too heavy for you. Is this honey? Yes, that's where we store the honey. Maia, come back here now! This is homely! It's the same old girl yelling. Get all dirty, Maia! Honey tastes good, but it's so bitter that I can't smell the honey. Now that they're older, I'm going to take them on a trip to the outside world to see the sky. Professor Acassandra can tell me that it's the sky, I wish I knew. Wait until we get there, then I'll explain everything to you, but don't think that the outside world is just fun. Little bees can't go outside alone and understand themselves. The outside world is dangerous, you still don't realize how cruel it is, you have to be very careful. Yes, I know why Professor Acassandra. I wasn't there two years ago. So you should know that this is just a one-time thing, because there are even worse enemies, sometimes bigger than us. Be very careful with them. Don't be afraid, go back to your places. There are no times for the teeth of the coma. They can't get in, so you don't need to be afraid of any, my little ones. This is a frog. It never flies and very low over the water. If you don't, this is what can happen. They have a very long tongue. Don't worry, and the areas will never be allowed in here. Oh, Professor Acassandra. Does that mean we should never go near the areas? That's right, and don't forget. You're Willie. Yes, I'm Willie. You seem to be very clever. No, I've been in this class for two years. Well, I'm Maya. I've heard that said about me. Yes, but only terrible things. You ask people so many questions that I almost scream. The world can be very cruel. For example, when it rains, it's not very pleasant. When it does, they go home, the condos are starving. If it's raining outside, what's the best thing a bee can do? Do you want to smell your answer, Willie? Well, we had to stay home. What would happen if we didn't stay home, Professor? I want to tell you, dear. What's that noise? Please stay in your seats and I'll be right back. What's the matter? There must be something wrong. Maya, Maya, Maya, where are you going? Come back! Come back here! Go back out! No, Maya. Maya, come back! It's not safe to go out there! Oh, why are you? What sound are you making? Oh, why are you? What sound are you making? It's mine! It's not, it's not! Amen! This is the hunted person's! Ah, ah, ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! Everyone is going to see this pot. What's wrong with you here? So don't be sad anymore, my little one. Willie, you're the oldest. Watch out for yourself sometime, dude! You just turned into the floor that's responsible. Do what I say! Oh, fan... Oh, fan... Look, I made myself, dude! It's not just once, dude, seriously. It's the one we saw before. That's a picture, but since I'm responsible, I'll show you something else. Ah, dude... That's an area, isn't it? And a dangerous one too. I've seen a series called S Marta, and it really was one. Ah, in seed! No, isn't it? That's one inside the lion. Isn't it, isn't it? No, isn't it? No, isn't it? No, isn't it? Ah, ah, ah, ah... What a strong smell that's left out there. It's really not pleasant at all. Yours is no longer me. Teacher Cassandra said it was me. Just watching your spread. Just watching your spread. Just watching your spread. Just watching her spread out. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah... Ah, ah, ah, ah... Ah, ah, ah, ah... William, what are you doing? You should already be sleeping and studying? Ah, ah, ah, ah... Thank you, William, and you can go back to your place. Hmm... Maya, can you tell me what this is? Ah! But where is she? Can anyone tell me where she is? Did anyone see her leave? Yes, teacher. I saw her leave. She was ready to go, to see the storm. Ah! But what naughty child has to be always watching that girl? The world is beautiful again. Ah, how funny is it that I drink in green? No, and come to play with my friend. Warm up with me, jump with me. Have fun playing here with my friend. Give me your hand now. Like a speed car, it always turns. When it turns, it always turns. One, two, and three with me is fun. Come on, you'll see when you come back. You'll understand this is a pleasure. When we dance the flowers, we take them to the wind. Come on, give me your hand and join me. Warm up with me, jump with me. Come play fun here with your friend. Give me your hand now. Come play fun here with your friend. Come play fun here with your friend. Come join me, jump with me. Come, come, win and laugh with me. One, two, three. Like a speed car, it's always spinning. It's always spinning. It's spinning. Come and see how fun it is. Very good, very good. Maya, Maya, where are you? Answer me right away. It's Sandra, your teacher, Maya, where are you? Maya, Maya, now everything that is yours is over. You always get into trouble. You've seen a little bee. If you're looking for my other life, it's there. Let me stay there for a few minutes and see if I learn my lesson. Maya. What are you trying to see, Sandra? You should take advantage of the fact that you're locked up to give yourself a hard time. You've been too much, Maro, Tamaya. I'm going to have to punish you and send you to bed right now. But I didn't do anything wrong, I just wanted to see the storm. I don't care if you cause yourself a lot of trouble. Guys, I'm sorry. And don't go out exploring the world again. Okay? Guys, I'm sorry. Come on, stop being so lazy and get dressed. Why am I such a bum just because I want to see the world outside? Hmm, sometimes you're smarter and run away when no one's looking. I never have to find anything."

You don't know if I'm Maia. Sorry, I thought it was Willy. Maia, you try to go over there. You just look like Willy. No, I don't think so. Go on. Okay. So who did you decide to come with? Why did you come back? Sorry. I have to tell everyone. It's a very special day in my life. Even pulleys. Just look how bright I am. Come on, kids, let's get started. Cheers! Cheers! The first time is a little difficult. Maia, do you want to try it? Yes! That's what happens when you start flying high in the air. Ah! Willy isn't here? He's not. I can't miss this. Why is he so late? Do you see? Isn't he? Oh, it seems. I'm seeing that amazing face of his. Wow... Oh, that pair of \uc810. You're eternal. I think you're great, but time is in your pocket. I didn't want to learn to fly. That's not true, Maia. You were eager to fly, much more than the others. I'm sad because I can't fly. It's so hard to try. You knew, didn't you know, that's why you came back. Never mind, it's okay, Willi. Do you want me to tell you a nice story? I'm sure you knew I was embarrassed to make a fool of myself when I tried to fly. But you're my friend. You're very cool. You really are my friend. Just look at the little ones who are learning to fly. I don't see a little Maia from Niu. Do you think they're acting like Mali and didn't let you see? Try asking Professor Cassandra. Yes. And me? The scoundrels don't have to learn to fly. We are very intelligent. Maia must have behaved better. What a lack of protection. Don't do it to you. You don't understand. I have to get rich and I jump because I'm happy. What did Maia do this time? I know she's very fussy and she always gets me without any problems. But what was going to happen? Just a little more sound. No. Try to stay strong. Enough, I'm going to fight back. Spoken, It's good for you, Willy. You have to eat it all. To your mouth. Maia, I can't. What's wrong with you, Willy? What happened? It's together, but I'm going to relive it. But what's the point of being? Maia said I didn't have the strength and made me eat all that. Mom. Ah, it smells so good here. It's the flowers. They're so beautiful. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Allah, flower. Maia, Maia, where are you? I'm here, Professor Cassandra. I'm on my way. Hm. Maia. Maia, where are you? I'm here, Professor Cassandra. I'm on my way. Use it today. No, no! It's not formal! It's out! It's out! It must have been a button. Oh, that button is honey! It's going to be honey! Button on the head with a pop of honey. It won't have a purpose! I hope it wasn't. Hello, Bodia! You're here at home! Watch out, I'm going to come in with my pop! There is no contact of p \uc774\ub7ec cross. Um, I'll prove it. Oh, \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c t\u8fd1 Um or<|pt|> Oh, Liz\u0105\u0107! Another climate is a Caio of reasons. Ch\u00e1ira, so good! Ah, I'm so heavy! You're sure that enough is enough! I think I'm going home! Oh! Nobody told me that the treadmill is so heavy! I'll have to stop many times to tire you out! Oh! You're malacartas, we don't live together! The first time my mother is out of action! Why do you know about me? Who am I? Here I am! I've wanted to meet you for a long time! Aaaa Gurki mods! Don't you have the most jucellais! I'm motivating you to please this ashamediano for when I'm going... Hmm. There are many things BRT\u00cd! Ah 99antexis. There are lots of neurologists near me. Have you known me since Pio in X? Yes. It's very annoying to talk to you, who is always so shy and giving it away. Yes, I am like that, don't forget that I am a grasshopper! Yes, that's exactly what I am. Hi! If I wasn't tall, don't even start, grass would have nothing to do. Enjoy watching, Maya. It's easy to laugh. And I want to help you when you're in trouble. You're very easygoing. And you're always ready for problems. They're curious. Goodbye, Maya! Stretch! Hi! And the... Ahahah! Oh! Ehehehehehe! Oh! Oh! Ah! Heeeey! Yeah... Flip! Hmm... What a mess! My pate doesn't have time and my lint is all over! Very good. Today you learned how to collect honey. From... Eeeeeeeee! Hehehehehehe! You didn't eat honey like Maya and that's why your jars are still full. Hehehehehehe! You can't learn everything in a day with a nap, because that bitch Cassandra already knew that. Rome and Pavia weren't made. And then, I don't know what M\u00e9lio says. And then, you are. And the nap that the bitch Cassandra already knew that. Rome and Pavia weren't made not only in a day, because people have to rest. Hi, just be careful. When you fly, understand to be very careful with the arenas and their webs. They are our worst enemy. Oh, no! Where is Maya? Is she there, because you were Cassandra? There is no judge. Come like the nice flowers? Maya, Maya is from here. Hehehehe! Ah! What is that bitch Cassandra? I was going to give it to you. Maya! Oh, what are you going to see with the silver on the right? Maya, Maya! Hehehehe! Unpreparing the mirror is there, but we are going to see my view. Maya! Half a pain, no! Hehehehe! Hehehehe! Hehehehe! Aaaaah! Maya! Hmm... Hmm... Hmm... Hmm... Ah! Ah, ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah! What a fool, Maia! Ah, ah, ah! I'm flippo! You noticed the prince that the heart is left. What does that mean? No visit from the edareinha. Ah, ah, ah! Where is she, huh? Ask Cassandra! Ah, ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah! What a strange defense you must be talking about! Maia! We're finally home! Ah, ah! I didn't put the honey in! Careful! Strata! Ah, ah! Come in, I soaked it so much! Now there's nothing! I won't let you where me! I came from my pot! You are \ud83c\udfb6 Ah, ah! Ah, ah! Ah, ah ah! Ah, ah! Ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah... Ah, ah... What happened? I can't move my wings so tied up. Profitaira, Cassandra, where are you? I'm in need of help! Ah, ah, ah, ah... Profitaira, Cassandra, where are you? Come study, my ass, grandma! What am I going to do with the speech-being? I'm going to be completely alone in the middle of the forest and I can't grandma! What's going on? Why? What are you so sad about? Flip, stu! Your wings are all wet. I'll only give you a ride on my back. But I might fall! Hm... wish for a<|pt|> Press me to arrange the air in the b Chapo, there's an art of iceIsha Beau, that the air Moreoverganar Damn! Come on, ourah She was com\u00efta Before olaude But there it will be like that, the Mayas! Yes, I think he has his reasons! Professor Cassandra will grow up seeing where little Maya was. What will he say? I'm sorry, but I can't help you. I have to go! Adios little Maya! Lato! Lato! Little Maya, he never misses a flight. What he likes most is to fly near the blue sky, the indication of salt. The next episode will be very exciting, but I won't tell you why. I'll just tell you that it will be really fun! You'll see! Well, until next time! What he likes most is to lie close to the blue sky!"

        "original": " Once upon a time you see, in a strange lamp not far away, I met the chance a little bee upon a most unusual day. And when I asked who she was, she told me, my heart, no one be could ever be like my heart. My wife questioned me, why is no one so far away? My, my, she's always in a pretty pickle, my heart. Helping someone else's little my heart. My, everyone loves my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, come tell us what you see. Oh, hello my friends, as you can see, I'm a grasshopper, my name is Flip, I hope you like me, I know I look funny, but you get used to me, I come here often. At the moment, I'm not sure what story to tell you, nothing interesting has happened to me today at all. I think the life of a grasshopper can be very boring. Eating grass all the time and hopping about isn't very exciting, although I do like eating. I'm bored. I always said, but if I there was my friend, he has a swarm of bees coming along, back from gathering honey. There's such hard working little fellows, I really think they work too hard. They always fly in a swarm. Hello, hello my friends. Hello. Did you collect a lot of honey today? I'd be so happy if you'd give me a drop. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Well, just like them, busy busy all the day, not even time to say hello, how unfriendly they are, they make me drop by hat. Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. I wonder why I never take back so early. They usually stay away much longer. Something must be wrong. I wonder what is happening. All the spuzzling about it's most unusual, perhaps we're in luck and something exciting is going to happen. Hey, no little creepy, crawly. Are you going for a walk? I want to eat a cake. No, I don't think you can talk. He's still too young. He's just like a baby. All he does is open his mouth. I think he must be hungry. I know. There must be trouble in the beehive. It's on the other side of the ruined castle behind the big pine tree. A fine safe place. I don't don't go and see. It's a matter. I don't know who I am. If you don't know the past, where'd you come from? Come in. Of course you know me, I'm Cassandra. I was your teacher when you were at school. Cassandra? Today's a great hatching day. If you don't get me in all the little bees will die. You should have a good look at people before you say you don't know. We're so sorry, but you know we've got rules to obey. Lots of people try to get in here and make trouble and we're in charge here. You ought to have enough sense to change the rules at an important time like this. Don't you ever think first to silly boys? He just knows we're so important. Can I come in now? Yes, all right. Because I'm reflying. Yes, yes. Here I am at last. We've been waiting a long time. They might catch out any moment now. They're coming. Let's help them. Stay where I put you. That's me. I want that precisely. I want that quickly! No, no, no. No, no, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Ellen... How do I get out of here? How could this be a door somewhere? Oh dear. You're dead? That's Maya. I just have to break you door open. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hello. Anyone at home? Yes, Maya. We've been waiting for you. You're the last one to come out. And who is Maya? Am I Maya? Why did you call me Maya? Tell me please. Well, actually there's no real reason everybody's got to have a name. Oh. Have you got a name? I'm Cassandra. I'll look after you till you're big. Come. I'm glad I'm out. It was hot inside. It sure owned fault. The others came out long ago. What made you wait so long? I had a beautiful dream. A dream? But Maya, please never dream. Perhaps someday I'll tell you what I dreamt it was such fun. What happens now? Shall I jump? Or you come into fetch me? Don't worry. You're quite safe. Come along. Your life is just beginning and there's so much to learn. Oh. What are they doing? They're learning to fly in a swamp. What's that? Weebies always fly in a swamp. I don't understand. It's a little difficult to understand. I'll teach you easier things first. And why do they do that? Weebies have done that ever since we began. A long time ago. And why do these do this? Why don't you tell me, Miss Cassandra? I want to know why. How am I ever going to learn anything about life if you want to tell me about things? Be patient, Maya. I can't explain everything to who it wants. Come. Let's join the others. All right. And in the comb they put the eggs. Why do they do that? The eggs lie in the comb like birds eggs in the nest. And after a few weeks a little bees hatch. Just as you did. Was it iron and egg like that? Yes, you were. Watch how they put an egg in each of the holes. And then another bee comes and shuts it tight with wax. They are the worker bees. They only work inside the hive. They peel the hive and look after the eggs. They're very busy. For the queen lays a lot of eggs every day. I don't suppose you can remember when you were inside an egg, do you? Goodness. What is that child up to now? Oh, it's heavy. I've managed it. Oh, there you are. See, Miss Cassandra, I can do it as well. Good. But only one egg in each hole. But why? If there were two eggs together they could talk to each other. They wouldn't be so lonely, would they? Maya, we bees weren't born to spend our days talking. We were born to work. I worry about you. You really have such funny eyes. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm going to work. I worry about you. You really have such funny ideas in your little head. I like my idea two eggs instead of one. My dear Maya, experience has proved that one egg is better. But why is it better? We could make much bigger combs for bigger eggs. Come along. Let's get along. Oh, that smells good. What is it? It's hungry. It is good. That's honey that you can smell. Oh, I can't I move this as the others can. Leave that. It's too heavy for you. Is that all honey? Yes, we store the honey for the winter in here. Maya, come back here at once. Oh, it's lovely, Miss Cassandra. Oh, oh, oh. Good to smell our naughty child. What a miss you're in, Maya, really. Honey, taste nice. Come along, school is beginning. Now you're old enough. I'm going to take you on a trip to the outside world to see the sky. Miss Cassandra, would you please tell me what the sky is? I want to know. Just wait until we get there, then I'll explain everything to you. But don't think it's all fun out there. Little bees aren't allowed out there on their own. Do you understand? Huh? It's dangerous out there. You must understand how wicked it is and be very careful. Yes, I knew that, Miss Cassandra, because I've been in this class for two years already. Then you should know that this is a wasp and there are worse enemies. And we are so be very careful of them. There's no need for us. Now get back to your seats. There are no wasps inside the hive. They can't get in. So you really needn't be scared at all my little ones. This is a frog. Never fly too low over water because that's what my cat is. He's got a very long tongue. Don't worry, a frog can never get in here. Miss Cassandra, does that mean you must never never go near where there are any frogs? Correct, Willie. Don't forget. Are you Willie? Yeah, I'm Willie. You seem to be very clever. No, it's just that I've heard this lesson for years. Well, I am Maya. Have you heard about me? Yes, but only terrible things. You ask people so many questions they want to scream. The world can be a very cruel place. For example, when it rains it isn't a tall knife. When that happens, come back home or hide under a leaf. If it's raining outside, what's the best thing for a little bee to do? Willie, do you know? Well, you should stay at home. What would happen if he didn't stay at home, Miss Cassandra? My dear child, I've just told you. What's that terrible noise? Please stay at your desk. I'll be back very soon. Run some matter! Oh, what happened? Something must be wrong. Maya, Maya, where are you going? Come back. I'm going outside. No, Maya, Maya, come back. It isn't safe to go outside. Oh! What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! What are you doing? Oh my God! Oh my goodness! Where is this house, come come. You be quiet! Come on, come in! Stop crying, stop crying. You are the key quiet. Willie, you are the oldest. Keep order here. You do everybody sit. I'm your child. You must do that too. Oh! Oh no! I was! Oh my God! That's not a real one. It's the one before. It's only a picture. But since I'm in charge, I'll show you something else. Oh my God! This is a spider, isn't he ugly? Is there anything else? I saw a real one. Her name was Martha and she would have luck. She'd be the fiddle. No, it isn't. This is a dandy lion. Oh! I'm leaving the teacher to make a mistake. Oh! There's a strong wind blowing outside. And it isn't too nice. This guy isn't blue anymore. Ms. Cassandra said it was beautiful. I wonder what flow is that? What's going on in here? Ms. Cassandra! Willie, what are you doing here? Didn't I tell you all to say a toast to the... Thank you, Willie. Now you go back to your desk too. Maya, can you tell me what this is? Where is she? Does anybody know where she is? Anybody see her going out? Yes, I saw her going out. I know exactly where she's gone. She wanted to see the store. Oh no! What a naughty child she is! I have to watch her all the time, the silly girl! The world is looking beautiful again. Is that funny little girl man again? Come on, I'll give you your hand and gun with me. Sing with me. Come with me. Sing and play and have some fun and laugh with me. Come on, I'll give you your hand right now. Come on, I'll give you your hand. Like a carousel I turn around and around. Round and round. Round and round. One and one and two and three so fun with me. Turn around I'll show you why. You will be on this stand. This is wonderful. When we dance the breeze and flowers spin around. Come on, I'll give you your hand and dance with me. Sing with me. Jump with me. Sing and play and have some fun. Come on, dance with me. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Oh, oh, oh, oh, my. Yeah, wait a minute. Lift like a cup and right like a cup and dance with me. One, two, three. I bet you're done. Like a carousel we go round and round. Round and round. Round and round. Come and have some fun with me. Very, very good. Maya, Maya, where are you, Maya? Where are you, Maya? Answer me at once. It's your teacher, Miss Cassandra. Maya, where are you, Maya? I saw it happen, I'm telling you. You're all raising that. What's wrong? Have you seen a little bee? If you're looking for that naughty little girl she's out there. Let her study for a few minutes and learn a good lesson. Maya! Is it your little Miss Cassandra? I should sting you now. Now that you're trapped. You've been very naughty, Maya. I'm going to have to punish you and send you to bed straight away. Oh, I didn't do anything bad. I just want it doesn't matter. You caused me a lot of trouble. I'm sorry. And don't go exploring again. Yes, I'm sorry. Now, just lie there quietly and go to sleep. Why is it naughty of me to want to see the outside world? Next time I'll be clever and run away when nobody's looking. Then they'll never find me. This was our first story about bees. I hope you'll be watching next time. Because if you are, I'll tell you a little secret. Next time we meet, you'll see how big Maya is growing. She's ready to learn to fly, but not alone. Miss Cassandra is with her to see that she keeps out of trouble. Bye-bye, you see ya. You see, Maya? I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go.

Willie, you are the oldest. Keep order here. You do everybody sit. I'm your child. You must do that too. Oh! Oh no! I was! Oh my God! That's not a real one. It's the one before. It's only a picture. But since I'm in charge, I'll show you something else. Oh my God! This is a spider, isn't he ugly? Is there anything else? I saw a real one. Her name was Martha and she would have luck. She'd be the fiddle. No, it isn't. This is a dandy lion. Oh! I'm leaving the teacher to make a mistake. Oh! There's a strong wind blowing outside. And it isn't too nice. This guy isn't blue anymore. Ms. Cassandra said it was beautiful. I wonder what flow is that? What's going on in here? Ms. Cassandra! Willie, what are you doing here? Didn't I tell you all to say a toast to the... Thank you, Willie. Now you go back to your desk too. Maya, can you tell me what this is? Where is she? Does anybody know where she is? Anybody see her going out? Yes, I saw her going out. I know exactly where she's gone. She wanted to see the store. Oh no! What a naughty child she is! I have to watch her all the time, the silly girl! The world is looking beautiful again. Is that funny little girl man again? Come on, I'll give you your hand and gun with me. Sing with me. Come with me. Sing and play and have some fun and laugh with me. Come on, I'll give you your hand right now. Come on, I'll give you your hand. Like a carousel I turn around and around. Round and round. Round and round. One and one and two and three so fun with me. Turn around I'll show you why. You will be on this stand. This is wonderful. When we dance the breeze and flowers spin around. Come on, I'll give you your hand and dance with me. Sing with me. Jump with me. Sing and play and have some fun. Come on, dance with me. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Oh, oh, oh, oh, my. Yeah, wait a minute. Lift like a cup and right like a cup and dance with me. One, two, three. I bet you're done. Like a carousel we go round and round. Round and round. Round and round. Come and have some fun with me. Very, very good. Maya, Maya, where are you, Maya? Where are you, Maya? Answer me at once. It's your teacher, Miss Cassandra. Maya, where are you, Maya? I saw it happen, I'm telling you. You're all raising that. What's wrong? Have you seen a little bee? If you're looking for that naughty little girl she's out there. Let her study for a few minutes and learn a good lesson. Maya! Is it your little Miss Cassandra? I should sting you now. Now that you're trapped. You've been very naughty, Maya. I'm going to have to punish you and send you to bed straight away. Oh, I didn't do anything bad. I just want it doesn't matter. You caused me a lot of trouble. I'm sorry. And don't go exploring again. Yes, I'm sorry. Now, just lie there quietly and go to sleep. Why is it naughty of me to want to see the outside world? Next time I'll be clever and run away when nobody's looking. Then they'll never find me. This was our first story about bees. I hope you'll be watching next time. Because if you are, I'll tell you a little secret. Next time we meet, you'll see how big Maya is growing. She's ready to learn to fly, but not alone. Miss Cassandra is with her to see that she keeps out of trouble. Bye-bye, you see ya. You see, Maya? I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go."

Alme hacen \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438 as\u00ed Por eso la bella piensa \u00a1Ah! Los manger est\u00e1n accionados Al sonro swampas y cad\u00e1mense. A ver lo virus ha sido la miesta. \u00a1\uac00pidos, r\u00e1pido! Los pa\u00f1ales est\u00e1n de ritiendo. \u00a1porados, no bellmente los pa\u00f1ales! Que se est\u00e1 saliendo la m\u00eda. Est\u00e1 bombeando, se\u00f1ala. \u00a1Susca! \u00a1Susca! \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 gritan tanto? \u00a1Qu\u00e9 hueli! \u00a1Ven, mira! \u00bfQu\u00e9 est\u00e1s haciendo aqu\u00ed, hueli? Pues lo mismo que los dem\u00e1s, agitando mis alas... \u00bfQu\u00e9 te enter\u00eda para aqu\u00ed? \u00a1Maya! \u00bfHare c\u00f3mo si no hubiera huido eso? Hab\u00eda demasiadas abejas en la colmena, demasiado calor y ten\u00edan que jambrar. Ahora lo que tenemos que hacer es crear un acorguinte de aire. Cuando hace demasiado calor, la cera se derrite, los panales y los huevos y las larvas se mueren, \u00bfentiendes? \u00bfNo se mueren, \u00bfentiendes? \u00a1Eh, madre, \u00bfy a d\u00f3nde vas? \u00bfTueda de aqu\u00ed? \u00bfA\u00fan no vamos a prender a colar? \u00a1Qu\u00e9 lo es, s\u00ed! Pero cuando muevo mis alas, no puede evitarlo. \u00a1Ahhh! Bueno, lo he hecho otra vez. No lo han hecho otra vez, creo que est\u00e1n un poco chifladas. Me da lo mismo en mi peque\u00f1o agujero en la tierra. La temperatura es agradable, pero ellas tienen que construir una colmena con miles y miles de habitaciones. No, vaya, fr\u00e1gil. \u00a1Vamos, vamos! Si lecci\u00f3n, el \u00faltimo banco. Como ya he dicho anteriormente, los peores enemigos de las abejas est\u00e1n siempre al acecho en la oscuridad. Por eso una beja no debe nunca salir de la colmena por la noche. No lo olvid\u00e9is. Se\u00f1orita, \u00bfpuedes hacer una pregunta? S\u00ed, \u00bfqu\u00e9 es, Maya? Cuando podr\u00edamos salir por fin de aqu\u00ed volarnos la prometida hace ya m\u00e1s de una semana. Exactamente. Un viejo probar biodice, la experiencia es la madre de la ciencia. No ser\u00e1 tan impartinente. Cuando llegue la hora, saldr\u00e1 y sabolar. Y cuando llegare esa hora, eh? Y adem\u00e1s, \u00bfqu\u00e9 quiere decir con eso de cuando llegue la hora? Quiero decir que ser\u00e1 esta misma tarde. \u00a1Oye, oye, oye! \u00a1Tarata, tata! Taja, Maya va a volar, Maya va a volar. Ahora, Maya va a volar. Ahora, Maya va a volar. \u00a1Va a volar! Lo siento. \u00bfNo puedes mirar por donde vas? Estoy muy nerviosa porque me van a dejar volar por primera vez. \u00bfEs esto, Pendo? \u00bfY sab\u00e9is una cosa? Voy a dar directamente a ti al sol. \u00a1Tala, lara, lara! \u00a1Maya va a... \u00a1Crediosa est\u00e1 la peque\u00f1a! Pero yo recuerdo muy bien mi primer vuelo. Dios m\u00edo, hace tanto tiempo ya. \u00a1No os queremos enga\u00f1ar! Ahora vamos a volar, a volar, a volar. \u00a1Alto, alto! Esa m\u00ed. Dime, t\u00fa eres Willy, \u00bfeh? No, yo soy Maya. \u00a1Oh, pensaba que eres Willy! Anda, sigue, sigue, beche. \u00bfQu\u00e9 es lo que pasa con Willy? Nada, nada, t\u00fa sigue peque\u00f1a. Vale, vale. Bueno, est\u00e1s aqu\u00ed. \u00bfCree que estabas deseando volar? Y lo estoy. Pero antes ten\u00eda que contar a todo el mundo que voy a volar por primera vez. Ejepillado en mis alas. Virem, mire, como brillan. Vamos, ni\u00f1os, empecemos. \u00bfCrees que es un poco bajo, no crees? Vamos, Maya, intentalo t\u00fa. Muy bien. \u00a1Socoro, socorro, socorro! \u00a1Qu\u00e9 me queco! \u00a1Uy! Eso pasa siempre que se quiere volar demasiado alto. \u00a1Carraro! Aqu\u00ed falta alguien, \u00bfno est\u00e1 Willy? \u00a1No! \u00bfQu\u00e9 gracioso? Porque no se ha venido con nosotros a clase de vuelo. \u00bfSabe por qu\u00e9 no est\u00e1 aqu\u00ed, se\u00f1orita? Puede que est\u00e9 enfermo. Maya. Vete color de m\u00e1s y no s\u00e9 si es la verdad. Vete color de m\u00e1s y no s\u00e9 si es la volando. Ya se ha envido Willy. \u00bfQu\u00e9? \u00bfEntonces por qu\u00e9 ha vuelto? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no ten\u00edan ganas de volar? Eso no es cierto. No me engalles, estaba loca por volar. Mucho m\u00e1s que nosotros. Es por mi culpa, a m\u00ed, a m\u00ed se ha quedado atr\u00e1s. Porque yo no puedo volar por eso. No es verdad, no te has quedado aqu\u00ed por m\u00ed. \u00bfY qu\u00e9 importa por lo que me haya quedado? \u00bfNo quieres que te le han cuenta? \u00bfNo sab\u00edas verdad? \u00bfY yo ten\u00eda miedo a volar? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no se ha ido por eso? \u00bfQu\u00e9 idea se te meten en la cabeza? \u00bfNo es que me vac\u00ed de que no se volar es que no s\u00e9? Y voy a comprobar vio de las abejas, tiene raz\u00f3n. Una amigos el m\u00e1s preciado tesoro. Parece que las abejitas hacen su primera salida hoy. No veo a Maya con ellas. A no mejor no han encerrado otra vez. Siento curiosidad por saberlo. Preguntar\u00e9 a la se\u00f1orita, Casandra. Ya, ya, ya. \u00a1Hija, hija! Esto lo va a hacer mirar dos veces, se\u00f1ora. Nosotros nos atamotes unos tipos inteligentes. \u00bfQu\u00e9 mala educaci\u00f3n? Cuando salto a es mortales cuando se est\u00e1 hablando con una dama. Uy, usted no me comprende mi querida se\u00f1ora. Yo tengo la sangre ardiente y mucho, te aperejito mucho. \u00a1Amy, nuestra peque\u00f1a Maya, seguramente habr\u00e1 hecho ya alguna de las uyas. Es encantadora pero huita bien, esa muy trab\u00ed esa. \u00a1Creen, Aguena! Y ahora un poquito de sopa de pollo. Esta te dar\u00e1 fuertes para volar. No puedo comer m\u00e1s bollas. \u00a1M\u00e1s m\u00e1s m\u00e1s m\u00e1s! \u00a1Un poco de sopa! \u00a1Venga, abre la boca! Pero es que no puedo comer nada m\u00e1s. Empez\u00f3 sentirme mal y muy pesado. \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa, Willy? \u00bfEs que no te encuentras bien? \u00a1Ay, mi tripa est\u00e1 tan llena que reventar\u00e1! \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 est\u00e1 tan llena a tu tripa? Maya pensaba que no te llevo esta antes. \u00bfCu\u00e1ntas para volar? \u00bfY tuve que cooperme todo eso? \u00a1Ay! Ay, ay, Maya. \u00a1Ay, viene mi peque\u00f1a amiga! \u00a1En hora buena por tu primer vuelo, Maya! \u00bfEst\u00e1 tan preocupada que no me oyen? \u00bfQu\u00e9 viene, Willy? Aqu\u00ed deben ser las flores. \u00a1No son maravillosas! \u00a1Venos d\u00edas, flores! \u00a1Soy Maya! Maya! Maya, \u00bfd\u00f3nde est\u00e1s? S\u00ed, ya voy, se\u00f1orita, casando. Estar\u00e9 con esta seguida. Es muy duro el trabajo de recoger miel. Ay, ay, no, no. \u00a1Todo se la misma florna! Ay, ay, ay, ay! Esta debe ser un capullo. \u00a1Ehh, \u00e9, \u00e9, \u00e9, \u00e9! Esta es mi capullo. No sale aqu\u00ed, sale. Huma chacando la cabeza de la buena gente con un cachorro de miel. Ay, ha sido sin querer. \u00a1Hola! Hay alguien ah\u00ed de entrada. \u00a1Cuidado que me canme, Jarras! De haber de recolectar miel, no es un juego. Una vez nada, peda\u00f1o. Nada deber\u00edamos probar. \u00a1Mmm, \u00a1festa tan rica! Si tu Jarras est\u00e1 llena, no importa probar un poco. \u00a1S\u00e1ran un poquito! \u00a1Esta flor, huele especialmente bien! Creo que basta. Si recojo m\u00e1s, es al dra de la Jarras. Nadie me dijo que estaba piensaba tanto. Ay, Dios m\u00edo, lo que pesa tendr\u00e9 que descansar un poco. Ay, mijo, Rade\u00f1ez! \u00a1Jarrame, que se me ha vio de repente! Soy una oruba y una ramita. \u00a1Eves un bicarrorocho! Bueno, es que la peque\u00f1a Maya se ha cansado tan pronto. \u00bfY qui\u00e9n se est\u00e1 riendo de m\u00ed? Alguien dijo mi nombre. Soy yo. Me he tomado la libertad de re\u00edrme de mi peque\u00f1a m\u00eda. \u00a1Ahh! No tengo asmiedos, soy Flip, el saltamonte, si tu buen amigo. Te conozco muy bien, Maya. Conozco a m\u00ed, \u00bft\u00fa? \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1s? Aqu\u00ed arriba, en la hoja. No podr\u00eda sustarte que tambi\u00e9n rasme hablar. Y ahora dime que me conocen. Te conozco desde el d\u00eda en que saliste del panal. \u00bfQu\u00e9? \u00bfD\u00f3nde? \u00bfQu\u00e9 nac\u00ed? S\u00ed. \u00bfY su coc\u00f3 que para ti es normal saltar como un loco cuando hablas con alguien? No, es una costumbre, por eso se en el saltamonte. Me pas\u00f3 la vida saltando y comiendo y me divierto, y me lo pasaron. No te enfalves, prometo ayudarte cuando tengas dificultades. Si estoy seguro de que la estendr\u00e1s, siendo tan curiosa y tan impertidente. \u00a1Esta la vista! \u00a1Tere un momento! \u00a1Hiji! Cabezbro como salta. \u00bfQu\u00e9 conflicto el m\u00edo? Deber\u00edan hacer las carras de m\u00ed con una tapadera y tapo la que no se salga? \u00bfQu\u00e9 es? Bueno, bueno. \u00bfHab\u00e9is aprendido a recoger la miel, lo hab\u00e9is pasado bien? S\u00ed, pero no sirve de nada, recoger tanta como lo hizo Maya, porque la carra se vuelve tan pesada que es muy dif\u00edcil llevarlo. No se puede aprender todo en un d\u00eda, que a Sandra deber\u00edas saber muy bien eso. No se gan\u00f3, Zamora, en una hora. Las cosas necesitan su tiempo. Y no olvid\u00e9is que cuando vol\u00e9is hay que tener mucho cuidado con la ara\u00f1a y su tela. La ara\u00f1a es nuestro peor enemigo. \u00bfHab\u00e9is deshidado Maya otra vez? En cuanto la pierdo de vista se va. \u00a1Est\u00e1 volando por ah\u00ed! Tiene muchos p\u00e1jaros en la cabeza. \u00a1M\u00eda, c\u00f3mo se mueve todo en el encargo! \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya, que no quien medio tambi\u00e9n! \u00a1Est\u00e1 chica, est\u00e1! \u00a1Estoy aqu\u00ed, se\u00f1orita! \u00a1Cojame! \u00a1Dir a Maya! \u00a1Ey! \u00a1Ey! \u00a1Bueno, directamente hac\u00eda la tela ara\u00f1a! \u00a1Maya, Maya, Maya! \u00a1No te parece casi un momento que deb\u00e9is tener cuidado con la tela de ara\u00f1a! Pero claro, como siempre, t\u00fa te hab\u00edas ido otro sitio, Maya. \u00a1Maya, qu\u00e9date aqu\u00ed! \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1s? \u00a1Aqu\u00ed! \u00a1Maya aqu\u00ed! \u00a1Deja de hacer tonter\u00edas! \u00a1De hoy es Maya! \u00a1Maya, me dejaste! \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Esta b\u00e1sica se ha estado cerca! \u00a1Qu\u00e9? \u00a1Eres tu aflite! \u00a1Que das cuenta del peligro que es corrido! \u00a1No, que peligro! \u00a1Y es que no has visto la tela ara\u00f1a! \u00a1Y que es aflite! \u00a1Ya no s\u00ed, tu maestro! \u00a1Preg\u00fantese lo a la se\u00f1orita Casanda! \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Suscribete! \u00a1Suscribete! \u00a1Suscribete! \u00a1Suscribete! \u00a1Suscribete! \u00a1Suscribete! \u00a1Suscribete! \u00a1Suscribete! \u00a1Suscribete! Bueno, aqu\u00ed estamos de nuevo. \u00a1Despacio! No tirais la m\u00eda. \u00a1Con cuidado! \u00a1Vamos! \u00a1Ay! \u00a1Av\u00edare con cuidado! \u00a1Apiela, ya lo ve que la llaya! No voy a dejar que se r\u00edo en mi. Y enar\u00e9 en mi cara a otra vez. No tengo ganas. \u00a1Ara! \u00a1Ara! \u00a1Puera chante mordana! \u00a1Chante mordana! \u00a1Ara! Quiera eso. Ay, yo lo m\u00edo que me ha pasado ahora porque no puedo volar as\u00ed de repente. Se\u00f1orita, se\u00f1orita, donde est\u00e1? Se\u00f1orita, \u00bfqu\u00e9 es otro, se\u00f1orita? \u00bfQu\u00e9 es que es que es que es que es que es que es que es que es que es que es? \u00a1Escu! Se\u00f1orita, se\u00f1orita, que es Andra! No puedo volar m\u00e1s de m\u00edo que voy a hacer y que pasara cuando os curoca. \u00a1Escu! \u00a1Ni\u00f1ale, ni\u00f1ale! \u00a1Deque\u00f1a, Maya, \u00bfqu\u00e9 viene esa cara? Flip, eres t\u00fa! No, te has mojado las alas, \u00bfeh? Subete a m\u00ed lo, a mousse, se car\u00e1 mientras saltamos. \u00bfY si me caigo? Agarrate fuerte, voy a empear mis altos m\u00e1s largos, un dos, tres, yo, yo, yo, yo. \u00a1Ay! S\u00ed, esto es fant\u00e1stico. \u00a1Esto es vendo! \u00a1Ay que corte, alberto del viento! \u00a1Ahhh! \u00a1Ah, no! \u00a1Ay, que saltemos al Tomaya! \u00a1Hasta el tornado! \u00a1Escu! \u00a1Ay, para, para, para, para! \u00a1Y a estas bien! Se han sacado tus alas, Maya. S\u00ed, s\u00ed, nada puede haber sido como antes, Flip. \u00bfQu\u00e9 le vas a decir a tu maestra cuando te pregunte? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 has estado tanto tiempo por ah\u00ed fuera? \u00a1Ya, ya, ya! Me temo que no eso no te voy a poder ayudar, lo vas a tener que solucionar tu sola. \u00a1Hasta la vista! \u00a1Ya, ya, aqu\u00ed! \u00a1Ahh! La peque\u00f1a Maya no se cansa de volar.

Pero os aseguro que ser\u00e1 una historia divertida y emocionante. \u00bfAsentonces, amiguitos? \u00a1Ahh! \u00a1Ahh!",
        "translated": "In a country because of your color, Napeo la beja under the sun And it was famous in the place La beja maya And now you that she leaves firewood Ma' the beautiful This beautiful sweet to the beautiful maya Va' and the move without desar It is a world without malice There is no problem that not only mang\u00e1 The cross and sweet to the beautiful Maya Go' and to what I want Maya Ma' the beautiful Maya Go' and to the beautiful Maya Ma' I already learned to fly To this the password Vosquecito de avedules a bella no raso de aza franc Go ahead A few servings of plant juice A few servings of plant juice A morning is a delicious pleasure A good morning, ma'am, working so late One of the airways is very busy this morning so What I see A clearing, a queen beja The beauty of the beautiful Maya The beauty of the beautiful Maya A clearing, a queen beja That's why there's so much commotion The bejas are partying That you put them down quietly And they're not calling them Allie, there's a \u770b! Alme they make \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438 like this That's why the beauty thinks Ah! The handlers are powered by swampas and cadamens. Let's see what a virus the miesta has been. Order, quickly! The diapers are leaking. Porados, not beautifully diapers! That mine is coming out. It's pumping, she points out. Susca! Susca! What's happening? Why are they yelling so much? What a smell! Come, look! What are you doing here, hueli? Well, the same as the others, flapping my wings... What do I mean for you here? Maya! Will I pretend I hadn't run away from that? There were too many bees in the hive, too much heat and they had to jam. Now what we have to do is create an air corguine. When it's too hot, the wax melts, the combs and the eggs and larvae die, you know? They don't die, you understand? Hey, mother, where are you going? Tueda from here? Aren't we going to start straining yet? What it is, yes! But when I move my wings, it can't help it. Ahhh! Well, I've done it again. They haven't done it again, I think they are a little crazy. I don't care in my little hole in the ground. The temperature is pleasant, but they have to build a hive with thousands and thousands of rooms. No, wow, fragile. Go Go! Yes lesson, the last bank. As I have said before, bees' worst enemies are always lurking in the dark. That is why a bee should never leave the hive at night. Don't forget it. Miss, can you ask a question? Yes, what is it, Maya? When we could finally get out of here, the one we promised more than a week ago flew away. Exactly. An old prove biosays, experience is the mother of science. It won't be as impartial. When the time comes, he will go out and taste. And when will that time come, eh? And also, what do you mean by when the time comes? I mean it will be this afternoon. Hey Hey hey! Tata, tata! Taja, Maya is going to fly, Maya is going to fly. Now, Maya is going to fly. Now, Maya is going to fly. She's going to fly! I'm sorry. Can't you look where you're going? I am very nervous because they are going to let me fly for the first time. Is this it, Pendo? And do you know one thing? I'm going to give you the sun directly. Tala, lara, lara! Maya is going to... The little girl is amazing! But I remember my first flight very well. My God, it's been so long. We don't want to deceive you! Now let's fly, fly, fly. Stop, stop! Is to me. Tell me, you're Willy, huh? No, I am Maya. Oh, I thought you were Willy! Go on, go on, go on, drink. What's wrong with Willy? Nothing, nothing, you continue little. OK OK. Well, you are here. Do you think you were looking forward to flying? And I am. But first I had to tell everyone that I'm going to fly for the first time. Exepled on my wings. Virem, look how they shine. Come on, kids, let's get started. You think that's a little low, don't you? Come on, Maya, you try it. Very good. Help, help, help! I'm sick! Oops! That happens whenever you want to fly too high. Carraro! Someone is missing here, isn't Willy? No! How funny? Because he hasn't come with us to flight class. Do you know why he is not here, young lady? He may be sick. Maya. You're getting too red and I don't know if it's true. You're getting too red and I don't know if it's flying. Willy's already sent. What? Then why did she come back? Why? Why didn't she feel like flying? That's not true. Don't fool me, she was crazy about flying. Much more than us. It's because of me, me, she's been left behind. Because I can't fly because of that. It's not true, you didn't stay here for me. And what does it matter why I stayed? Don't you want them to tell you? You didn't know, right? And I was afraid to fly? Why didn't she leave because of that? What idea do you have in your head? Isn't it that I emptied myself of the fact that I don't know how to fly, is it that I don't know? And I'm going to check it out of the bees, you're right. A friend is the most precious treasure. It seems that the little bees are making their first exit today. I don't see Maya with them. Maybe they haven't locked her up again. I'm curious to know. I'll ask the young lady, Cassandra. Now, now, now. Oh, my dear! This will make you look twice, madam. We're such clever fellows. What rudeness? When I jump to our deaths when I'm talking to a lady. Oh, you don't understand me, my dear lady. I've got hot blood and a lot of it, I'm going to get you ready. Amy, our little Maya, has probably done some of those things already. She's charming but she's a good runaway, she's very sluggish. Believe me, Aguena! And now a little chicken soup. This will give you strength to fly. I can't eat any more dumplings. More, more, more! Some soup! Come on, open your mouth! But I can't eat any more. I began to feel sick and very heavy. What's the matter, Willy? Aren't you feeling well? Oh, my belly is so full it's going to burst! Why is your belly so full? Maya thought I didn't bring you this one before. How many to fly? And I had to cooperate with all that? Ouch! Ouch, ouch, Maya. Ouch, my little friend is coming! Congratulations on your first flight, Maya! Are you so worried that you can't hear me? What's coming, Willy? This must be the flowers. Aren't they wonderful! Come on, flowers! I'm Maya! Maya! Maya, where are you? Yes, I'm coming, young lady, getting married. I'll be with this one often. It's very hard work collecting honey. Ouch, ouch, no, no. It's all the same flower! Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch! This must be a bud. Hey, hey, hey, hey! This is my bud. It doesn't come out here, it comes out. Huma hitting the good people's heads with a honey puppy. Ouch, it was by accident. Hello! There's someone there at the entrance. Watch out, Jarras! If we have to collect honey, it's not a game. One time, nothing, little thing. We shouldn't try anything. Mmm, what a delicious party! If your Jarras is full, it doesn't matter if we try a little. S\u00e1ran a little! This flower, it smells especially good! I think that's enough. If I collect more, it's Jarras's dra. Nobody told me that I was thinking so much. Oh, my God, how heavy it is, I'll have to rest a little. Oh, my son, Rade\u00f1ez! Jarrame, I've suddenly seen myself! I'm a caterpillar and a twig. You're a little rooster! Well, it's just that little Maya got tired so quickly. And who's laughing at me? Someone said my name. It's me. I've taken the liberty of laughing at my little one. Ahh! I'm not afraid, I'm Flip, the grasshopper, yes, your good friend. I know you very well, Maya. I know myself, do you? Where are you? Up here on the leaf. You couldn't be afraid that I also scratched my head. And now tell me that they know me. I've known you since the day you came out of the hive. What? Where? What was I born? Yes. And your problem that it's normal for you to jump like crazy when you talk to someone? No, it's a habit, that's why I'm a grasshopper. I spent my life jumping and eating and I have fun, and they had fun with me. Don't get carried away, I promise to help you when you have difficulties. I'm sure you will be, being so curious and so impertinent. This is the view! Wait a minute! Son! Headstrong as he jumps. What a conflict is mine? They should make faces at me with a lid and I cover the one that doesn't come out? What is it? Well, well. Have you learned to Gathering honey, did you have a good time? Yes, but it's no use collecting as much as Maya did, because the cart becomes so heavy that it's very difficult to carry it. You can't learn everything in one day, and Sandra should know that very well. It wasn't won, Zamora, in an hour. Things take time. And don't forget that when you fly you have to be very careful with the spider and its web. The spider is our worst enemy. Have you undried Maya again? As soon as I lose sight of her, she's gone. She's flying around! She's got a lot of birds in her head. Mia, how everything moves on the errand! Maya! Maya, who's half there too! She's girl, she's here! I'm here, miss! Catch me! Tell Maya! Hey! Hey! Well, I was straight to the spider web! Maya, Maya, Maya! Don't you think it's almost a moment that you should be careful with the spider web! But of course, as always, you had gone somewhere else, Maya. Maya, stay here! Where are you? Here! Maya here! Stop messing around! Today is Maya! Maya, you left me! Maya! Maya! This basic has been close! What? You are your aflite! You realize the danger that is run! No, what danger! And you have not seen the spider web! And that is aflite! Not anymore, your teacher! Ask Miss Casanda! Maya! Maya! Maya! Maya! Maya! Maya! Maya! Subscribe! Subscribe! Subscribe! Subscribe! Subscribe! Subscribe! Subscribe! Subscribe! Well, here we are again. Slowly! Don't throw mine away. Carefully! Come on! Ouch! I'll be careful! Apiela, you can see that the call! I won't let him laugh at me. And he'll face me again. I don't feel like it. Ara! Ara! Puera chante mordana! Chante mordana! Ara! Want that. Oh, it's mine that happened to me now because I can't fly like that suddenly. Miss, miss, where are you? Miss, what's another, miss? What is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is? Listen! Miss, miss, it's Andra! I can't fly any more than mine, what am I going to do and what will happen when I get to you. Listen! Girl, girl! Damn, Maya, what's that face? Flip, it's you! No, you've wet your wings, eh? Get on me lo, a mousse, he'll face while we jump. What if I fall? Hold on tight, I'm gonna start my longest highs, one two three, yo yo yo yo. Ouch! Yeah, this is fantastic. This is for sale! Ouch, cut it, Alberto of the wind! Ahhh! Oh no! Ouch, let's jump into the Tomaya! To the tornado! Hey! Ouch, stop, stop, stop, stop! And you're fine! Your wings have come off, Maya. Yeah, yeah, nothing can be the same again, Flip. What are you gonna say to your teacher when she asks you? Why have you been out there for so long? Now, now, now! I'm afraid I can't help you with that, you're gonna have to figure it out on your own. See you later! Now, now, here! Ahh! Little Maya never tires of flying. She'd like to fly high, really high until she reaches the sun. In the next episode, Maya the bee no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not gonna tell you anything. But I assure you that it will be a fun and exciting story. So, my friends? Ahh! Ahh!"

Esas son las abejas sobre eras que trabajan solamente en la colmena Ellas construyen los panales y cuidan de los huevos Tienen que trabajar mucho porque nuestra reina pone muchos huevos diariamente Seguramente no te puedes imaginar que tu alg\u00fan d\u00eda tambi\u00e9n fuiste un huevo, \u00bfverdad? \u00a1Oh, Maya! \u00bfD\u00f3nde se ha metido esa peque\u00f1a? \u00bfQu\u00e9? \u00bfQu\u00e9? \u00bfQu\u00e9? \u00bfQu\u00e9? \u00bfQu\u00e9? \u00bfQu\u00e9? \u00bfQu\u00e9? \u00bfQu\u00e9? \u00bfQu\u00e9? Ay, como pisa \u00bfLo que he conseguido? Est\u00e1 ah\u00ed arriba \u00bfMe ense\u00f1arita a casa de la ella lo hace hacer? Espera un momento, s\u00f3lo un huevo en cada celda \u00bfY por qu\u00e9? Cuando salgan si son dos podr\u00e1n entretenerse De la otra manera es demasiado aburrido Pero Maya, nosotros no venimos a este mundo para entretenernos y no para trabajar Me sorplendes y jam\u00eda, yo nunca tuve pensamientos tan extra\u00f1os como t\u00fa Sin embargo, creo que las huevos en una celda es mejor Pero la experiencia de cientos de a\u00f1os nos ha ense\u00f1ado que es mejor as\u00ed \u00bfY por qu\u00e9 es mejor as\u00ed? S\u00ed, porque no se hacen celda, es para muchos huevos Vengo el mig\u00f3s y dame \u00bfQu\u00e9 hay en huele aqu\u00ed? \u00bfY de d\u00f3nde viene? \u00bfVes tencando de repente mucha abre? Ya lo s\u00e9, es por la miel que est\u00e1 soliendo \u00bfA ahora? Estaba Hisa Ditaba Liden esta fuerza \u00a1Ah\u00ed! D\u00e9jalo, p\u00e9sate demasiado para ti. \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1 llena de miel? S\u00ed, aqu\u00ed se guarda la miel para el invierno. Maya, ven aqu\u00ed a lo mismo. Una beja no debe ser golosa. Ay! Se\u00f1orita, \u00bfcasi andrasta riqu\u00edsima? \u00a1Oh! \u00a1Oh! \u00a1Oh! \u00a1Oh! \u00a1Oh! \u00a1Enterrible! Ah, hay que ver c\u00f3mo te has puesto. Est\u00e1 muy rica, pero muy te gajo, \u00a1ah\u00ed no puede moverme! \u00a1Ve! Ma\u00f1ana o a los humo pasado ma\u00f1ana vais a salir por primera vez a ver el cielo azul. Se\u00f1orita Cassandra, \u00bfpuedes explicarme qu\u00e9 es un cielo azul? Espera que puedas salir de la colmena, entonces te lo explicar\u00e9 todo. Pero no te creas que fuera toda esta diversi\u00f3n, ninguna peque\u00f1a beja de bipolar sola afuera. \u00bfMe entiendas? Afuera os esperan muchos peligros y deb\u00e9is aprender cu\u00e1l es son para evitarlos. S\u00ed, si, se\u00f1orita Cassandra, yo ya lo s\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 he suspendido dos veces. Bueno, Willi, entonces t\u00fa sabr\u00e1s que este es un avisp\u00f3n nuestro peor enemigo. Es diez veces m\u00e1s grande que nosotros. Cuidaros mucho de no encontraros con el ni\u00f1o. No, no os quer\u00eda asustar. Volveza vuestro sitio r\u00e1pido. Aqu\u00ed dentro no hay avispones. Nuestras viejas abejas tienen mucho cuidado. No teng\u00e1is miedo. En esta l\u00e1mina veis a una rana. No vol\u00e9is nunca demasiado cerca del agua. Si solarca y pegabasa lengua os atrapa alguna vez, no hay forma de escapar. Bueno, calma, calma. \u00bfA qui\u00e9n nunca podr\u00eda entrar una rana? Se\u00f1orita, significa eso que no debemos acercarnos nunca a los sitios donde hay ranas. As\u00ed es, Willi, no lo olvides. \u00bfT\u00fa te llamas, Willi? S\u00ed, yo soy Willi, porque tienes esa bosta en rara. La pubert\u00e1, ya tengo dos a\u00f1os. Bueno, yo soy Maya. \u00bfA lo mejor ha sido hablar de m\u00ed? S\u00ed, pero solo cosas madas. Vuelvez lo cada se\u00f1orita con tus preguntas y cosas as\u00ed. Como todo en esta vida el mundo tiene dos caras. Una bonita y otra menos bonita. Si, por ejemplo, yo he veo aitormentano, es nada bonito. En ese caso hay que volver inmediatamente a la colmena o buscar refugio debajo de las hojas. Por ejemplo, hoy que yo he vella y mucho viento, \u00bfqu\u00e9 debe hacer una peque\u00f1a beja obediente? \u00bfNo sabes t\u00fa, Willi? S\u00ed, nos quedamos en la colmena. \u00bfY qu\u00e9 le ocurrir\u00eda una beja que sale con este tiempo? Pero \u00bfqu\u00e9 es? \u00bfQu\u00e9 es? \u00bfY te acabo de explicar? \u00bfPero qu\u00e9 l\u00edo es este? \u00bfQu\u00e9 daros en vuestros idiomas enseguida? \u00bfVuelvo, Vale? No, no, no, no, no. \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa? Creo que con esta tormenta se deben de cerrar todas las puertes huelas. \u00bfD\u00f3nde vas? \u00bfVaya a ver qu\u00e9 hay fuera? Pero, pero Maya, quedate. \u00bfQu\u00e9? Maya, no debe salir.

A little honeycomb, a little honeycomb Well, let them have a lot to do, they could at least say good morning Such strange behaviour is not usual for them It's not usual at all So where's my hat? Colic! And it's so windy that my hat is blowing off But anyway, here they are again And something extraordinary happens to me Oh, Ygan! Hey, what's the matter with them? Oh, how strange They're running back and forth, back and forth, back and forth like crazy! Oh, the little one, taking a walk! You shouldn't be surprised that I don't answer me She doesn't know how to talk yet, it's like little children open their little mouths just to be fed I have an idea, since in the beehive She got curious about something special How about we go there and find out Hey! In that castle, next to the big fir tree is the beehive What's going on? Why don't you let me in? Don't you know who I am? The password without a password there is no way through But well, it's that you don't recognize me, I'm Cassandra The one who has taught you everything you know, I have been your teacher Oh, Cassandra! Cassandra? Today is a great day, the ceran I have not laid hands and sisters But if you don't let me through, if it is Cristiar\u00e1n And you here wasting my time Please, calm down, that Miss Cassandra We understand you but from time to time understand each other too We have orders to follow I also have to have zero orders but you have to know how to distinguish when an order An order and when it should stop being the and the case is urgent We couldn't know that it was so important Well, will you let me through or not? But of course, naturally, we pass you Well, I'm here now, I hope I don't get there so soon No, no, it's going to start any moment It's already starting, come on, hurry up With the parros doras in a pile Quick, give you grisos! Look! Look! Look! Look! Look! Look! Look! What is this? Is there no one? Does it not open? I'm going to push or I'll die, right? And this? Is it that you cry? Tell me what to do? Wow! Everything has to be done by one person! There is no one. Of course there is someone, I'll leave once, Maya, let's hurry up the only one missing Maya, who is Maya? Did Maya become? Because you stunk me up without a name, I called you. Well, there is no special reason, simply because each one of you has to have a name. Ha! And do you have a name too? Yes, I am Miss Cassandra and until you are older I will take care of you. I am glad I went out, I was very uncomfortable. Was it your fault? The others have gone out a while ago? Why didn't you go out before, little one? Was I showing something very vain? What are you saying? A bee dreaming? Look, do you want me to tell you? It was a very funny thing? Oops! How does this work? I have to jump and look for myself Wait, I'll go look for Maya She's going to take me in Look at me Come on, come on! If the dreams are over Come on, now reality awaits you, you'll have to learn many things Why fly to see here? They're starting to gather to eat But gather a swarm? What's that? No, I said they gather to swarm Don't I understand? It's too boring for you to understand First you'll have to learn simpler things Oh, yes And why do they do it? Huh? Because bees have been doing this since we began to exist And why do bees do this? Why don't you explain it to me? But in a way that I understand Mara? And how am I supposed to understand things and no one badly explains? But little one one with satra-sotra not all at the same time Come on, let's go with the others Okay, okay And why? Why one thing after another? Because your little head is too small to understand them all Wait, miss! I know why you don't tell me Because you don't know either Because you're laughing I don't find it so funny Oh, what a mess! Oh, what a mess What's the matter with you? Ah, it seems that they are going to swarm That's why there is so much excitement In reality the solution does not happen anymore On the day of the births there are too many bees in the hive And half of them have to migrate to find a new hive I've seen this many times But since there is nothing more interesting I will keep watching how the bees go and tell them Maya, Maya no Mayas over there No, why not Why that? You'll see later And that was please don't ask so many you're going to get back to me hopefully telling me why But there is god in front of me of course there is Maya, Maya, what is it doing here? Why do they leave the outside world, right? But I can't get out If you know, come back right now Hey, eh, good morning, miss But it's that I'm so ugly that I scare them, miss What is there to go through to get inside your head? What? You finally see that day over there What is it to me? It was flip, the grasshopper is a rather lazy fellow He mives all alone something incontainable for the bees Now I'm going over there Maya Bye, miss! What little girl is there? Listen to me carefully, Maya I can't waste all my time with you I hope you can understand Yes, I understand, but what are they doing there? With this there are new honeycombs And inside the honeycombs they lay the eggs And what do they do it for? In the honeycombs the eggs are protected And after a few weeks little bees like you are born I was an egg like that Naturally Is it how they lay an egg in each cell? Do you see? Now another bee comes and closes the entrance with wax So what? Those are the bees on the threshing floors that work only in the hive They build the honeycombs and take care of the eggs They have to work hard because our queen lays many eggs every day Surely you can't imagine that you were once an egg too, right? Oh, Maya! Where has that little one gone? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? Oh, how does it tread What have I got? It's up there Can you show me the house of the one she makes it do? Wait a minute, only one egg in each cell And why? When they get out if there are two of them they can entertain themselves The other way is too boring But Maya, we did not come to this world to entertain ourselves and not to work You surprise me and jamia, I never had such strange thoughts as you However, I think that eggs in a cell is better But the experience of hundreds of years has taught us that it is better this way And why is it better this way? Yes, because they are not made in a cell, it is for many eggs I come the crumbs and give it to me What's in here smells? And where does it come from? Do you see suddenly having a lot of open? I already know, it's because of the honey that is spreading Now? Was Hisa Ditaba Liden this force There! Leave it, it weighs too much for you. Where is it full of honey? Yes, honey is stored here for the winter. Maya, come here for the same thing. A honeybee must not be greedy. Oh! Miss, are you almost a delicious honeybee? Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Terrible! Ah, look how you've become. It's very tasty, but very fat, you can't move me there! Go! Tomorrow or the next day you're going to go out for the first time to see the blue sky. Miss Cassandra, can you explain to me what a blue sky is? I hope you can go out. of the hive, then I will explain everything to you. But don't think it was all this fun, no little bipolar baby alone outside. Understand me? Many dangers await you outside and you must learn what they are to avoid them. Yes, yes, Miss Cassandra, I already know why I failed twice. Well, Willi, then you will know that this is a hornet our worst enemy. He is ten times bigger than us. Be very careful not to meet the child. No, I didn't want to scare you. Return your site quickly. There are no hornets in here. Our old bees are very careful. Do not be afraid. In this picture you see a frog. Never fly too close to water. If solarca and pegabasa tongue ever catches you, there is no way to escape. Well, calm down, calm down. Who could never get into a frog? Miss, that means we should never go near places where there are frogs. That's right, Willi, don't forget it. Is your name, Willi? Yes, I'm Willi, because you have that weird shit. Puberty, I'm already two years old. Well, I'm Maya. Maybe it was talking about me? Yes, but only bad things. Come back to each lady with your questions and things like that. Like everything in this life, the world has two faces. One pretty and one less pretty. If, for example, I have seen aitormentano, it is not pretty. In that case you must immediately return to the hive or seek shelter under the leaves. For example, today when it's clear and windy, what should an obedient little beja do? Don't you know, Willi? Yes, we stayed in the hive. And what would happen to a baby that goes out in this weather? But what is it? What is it? And did I just explain to you? But what mess is this? What to give you in your languages \u200b\u200bright away? I'll be back, okay? No no no no no. What's happening? I think that with this storm all the doors should be closed. Where are you going? Go see what's outside? But, but Maya, stay. That? Maya, you shouldn't go out. Me n'ah here. Today! Today! Today! Today! Order there! Yes, what are you doing! Oh! But! Don't take it from me! Little, for the sake of it! You shouldn't be bothering me and all that! What a touch! Oh! Today! Today! But hey, I don't get this floreno. Today! What's happening here? What's happening here? Because? Because? Where are you going? Today! Today! Where are you going, can you shut them up, Willy! Aren't you the oldest here? Can I order a little? I'll tell you and... Ahhh! Where are we going, putter of the curve this! Ahhh! Where are you both going? Ahhh! Today! A record po! Ahhh! Ahhh! A record po! Today! But, but it's not true! It's the one we saw before, you don't remember, eh? Since I'm the teacher, now I'm going to teach you something else. Hmmm! So. Ahhh! Now it's a spider. Spider! Spider! That's why it's called a spider, of course. Yeah! I have seen one in passing. His name is Teclay and he was playing the violin. Puili, I think you're crazy! No, no, no, no, I'm crazy. I already play the violin! This is a tulip tree, the honey of the tulip tree! This is a tulip! You don't believe it, I'm lying! I'm also not sitting in the choc and mouth! Girl! Girl! Girl! Girl! Girl! Girl! Girl! Good luck with your creace! No! The world is not as wonderful as Sirman. And they say that heaven is made? What's so nice about all this? Girl! I think it's a tulip! But wow! Ah! Safe, Cassandra! What are you doing here? And I haven't told you to stay in your places. Side to play me! Very good, you had time! Feel you! Well, Maya, you want to tell me what this is! Hey! Oh! Maya, where is she? Does anyone know where she is? Has anyone seen her come out of it? Yes, I have seen it. You're out! That's also where she went, she wanted to see the storm. Oh! What a disobedient little girl! It gives me nothing but annoyance! Nasa more than displeasures! Look, it seemed like something else! If the world were always so full of colors, the sky so blue. Oh, there's the funny guy from before! I am a Santa, a mountain man who likes the sun and jumping without stopping. I have a lot of fun anywhere watching you or work. Lala, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la! Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee! Lala, la, la, la, la, la, la! Eee! Eee! Shovel, veja, mayate, coke, take care! Yes it leaves the honeycomb! But there is a mischievous one who is going to irritate me. Always loved to play. I got a jump, boy. Far away to search. To my good Maya, they come back without talking. Everyone knows me and calls me prince. I'm cold, cock cold. I tell the stories that are seen here in my small country. Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee! I am a jump, mantez who likes the sun. I'm cold, cock cold. Everyone knows me and calls me fl\u00ed. Eee! Eee! Eee! I am the jump, mantez that likes the sun. Bredo, open, very well done! Maya! Maya! Where could he have gone? Maya, where are you? Answer me? Maya, you answer! I'm Miss Cassandra! What doesn't she say? Yes, not with these right now! Yes, by chance you look for the spoiled guy who almost knocked us over when we passed him and you'll find him there. Why do you say so much nonsense? Maya! I should take advantage of the opportunity and hit you so hard that you can't move. Eee! Well, I'm going to tell you something and, Jami, how come you don't want to obey me at all? I will punish you and put you to bed immediately. Oh! I didn't need that! I haven't done anything wrong, you just didn't add me. But you don't add me if everyone does what they want. Just so you know, curious children sound familiar to me, tipati. Well, well, that's enough. And I recommend that you stay very still and go to sleep. Well, maybe it's a bad idea to escape, but why? If I want to know what it looks like in the outside world, is that bad? I already know what I'm going to do. Next time I'll be more careful so I don't get caught. That's asylum, yes sir."

Das ist unser Geheimnis. Wie sind die den H\u00fcgel am Ende vom Strand? Du kannst es dir noch mal \u00fcberlegen. Es ist wirklich eine tolle Sache, was wir da gefunden haben. George, komm! K\u00f6rten, sind Sie da? Was ist los mit Ihnen? Ich habe aber seit Wochen keine Information mehr verdient bekommen. Ich habe noch nicht mehr \u00fcbersteh, Sie sind nicht k\u00fcrfen, denen wieder Gesch\u00e4fte machen. Hallo, Karne. Ihr Chancen, die sch\u00f6n mal wieder Ihre Stimme zu h\u00f6ren. Ich habe das Gef\u00fchl, Ihre T\u00e4tigkeit ist in einen unangenehmen Stadion getreten. Pech f\u00fcr Sie. Aber \u00fcbrigens noch was. Sie werden Mr. K\u00f6rten auf der Frequenz nicht mehr empfangen. Chancen, h\u00f6r Sie. Wir sind sich wohl dar\u00fcber klarh\u00f6rten, dass Sie Unernehmlichkeiten bekommen. Zuerst einmal werden wir beide uns gr\u00fcndlich unterhalten. Ich glaube, hier ist schon eh nicht keiner mehr gewesen. Man kann nicht mal das Ende sehen. Ihr muss unheimlich weit reingehen, kommt. Das ist keine H\u00f6hle. Das ist ein Tunnel, die noch jemand gebaut hat. Der ist ja unheimlich lang. Hier geht sich weiter bis unschneinz mehr. Was ist denn das? Das ist ein Hund. Hey, wir bist du, Lenn. Im Gervor geh\u00f6rt. Keine Ahnung, vielleicht die und jemanden auf Strand. Chimmy. Chimmy, wo bist du? Das ist doch George. Ich h\u00f6r wohl nicht richtig. Das ist also jetzt tolles Geheimnis. Kommt. Chimmy, wie oft habe ich dir schon gesagt, dass du keine Kaininchen jagen sollst? F\u00fcr Sie mich gef\u00e4lligst anw\u00e4hig die Wassage. Mach dir in einartiger Hund so was. Du bist ein ganz schlimmer. Komm jetzt. Muss man dir denn alles tausend mal sagen? Hallo George. Dick. Was ist also Timmy? Woher wei\u00dft du denn sein Namen? Du hast ihn doch gerade gerufen. Der hat uns einen gro\u00dfen Schreck eingehabt. Der ist ja wirklich s\u00fc\u00df. George geh\u00f6rte dir? Ja. Und warum haben wir noch nicht im Haus gesehen? Vater hat mir verboten ihn zu behalten, aber ein jungerm Dopp versorgt ihn f\u00fcr mich. Ich w\u00fcrde lieber vorhangen, als das sich im Weg gehen w\u00fcrde. Und au\u00dferdem halt ist Uninen auch nicht aus. Jetzt kapiere ich, dass deshalb paust du also so viel ab. Aber du brauchst keine Angst zu haben. Wir verraten ein Geheimnis nicht. Ganz bestimmt nicht George. Versprech dir mir da. Ja, wir versprechen das. Uns gef\u00e4llt dir doch genauso gut wie dir. Ja. Freunde? Freunde. Ich fand das sowieso nicht gut, dass wir feinde waren. Was ich dir noch sagen wollte, George. Der Tunnel, den wir gefunden haben, das ist kein normaler Tunnel. Sehr weit sind wir nicht gekommen, aber wir haben ein paar Stufen gefunden. Ja, die f\u00fchren direkt in die Erde. Und ein Richtung zum Meer raus. Kommst du mit? Na klar, kommt. Hallo, Kinder. Na was ist nur mit meiner Einladung? Gehen wir lieber bevor ihr uns fragt, dass wir hier unten suchen. Ja, ich hab sowieso Hunger. Okay, wir kommen. Komm rein. Macht euch bequem. Und das ist euch. Entschuldig, das ist ein bisschen unaufger\u00e4umtisch. H\u00e4ndsch, seht euch mal das Fernrohr an. Oh ja, das ist mein Hobby. Ich bin ein bisschen unerbaut. Ich bin ein bisschen unerbautisch. Ich bin ein bisschen unerbautisch. H\u00e4ndsch, seht euch mal das Fernrohr an. Oh ja, das ist mein Hobby. Ich beobachte V\u00f6gel. Karin Island. Oh, ich kann ja ungelquenten Sturm ganz deutlich sehen. Eine Adderabend, B\u00fcrokorax. Beseltene K\u00fcstenv\u00f6gel. Ein paar davon hab ich auf der Insel ersp\u00e4t. Ja. Und euch hab ich nat\u00fcrlich auch gesehen. Na, wie geht es denn deinem Vater? Meinem Vater auch hier. Er ist fast fertig, hatte gesagt. Ah, ist da das? Ja. Der gute alte Quentin. \u00c4h, nun ja. Vielleicht k\u00f6nnte die mehrhelfenden Tisch dicken. Ein bisschen Kuchen und Kekse sind dort drin. Ich mache ihn zwischen den Tee. Nicht da oben. Du findest alles in dem Unterenfach, mein Junge. Oh, ein Schuldigung. Ach, du meine G\u00fcte. Die Tante. Ich meine meine Tante, Tante Jun. Sie kommt zum Tee. Habt ihr das vergessen? Sie kennen sie doch sicher. Oh ja, nat\u00fcrlich. Die Tante ist wirklich reizend. Ich hab ihm ein bisschen leider gleich weg. Tut mir leid. Auf Wiedersehen und vielen Dank. Ich schau aber. Es ist wirklich b\u00fcrt von uns. Entschuldigen Sie bitte. Trotzdem vielen Dank. Auf Wiedersehen. Na ja, dann vielleicht ein anderem mal. Wer ist denn Tante Jun? Wir haben \u00fcberhaupt keine Tante Jun. Nat\u00fcrlich nicht, aber trotzdem hat er gesagt, er kennt sie. Der tut nur, soll's w\u00e4re ein Freund von Vater. Aber ich hab den kein noch niemals vorgesehen. Du h\u00e4ttest ihn nicht sagen d\u00fcrfen, dass Vater fast fertig ist. Du wei\u00dft genau, dass das geheime ist. Ich schliebe mir leid, Jot. Ich hab nicht dran gedacht. Meinst du nicht \u00fcbertreibst die Sachen ein bisschen, Jot? Nein, ich glaub, sie hat recht. Du hast bestimmt nicht gesehen, was in dem Schrank war. Da war ein Funkr\u00e4t als ziemlich gro\u00dfes. Oh Mann! Wirklich ausgezeichnet, Kirk. Und ja, es tut mir leid, ich... Sie waren so pl\u00f6tzlich weg. Ich konnte \u00fcberhaupt keine Fragen stellen. Ich hab alles geh\u00f6rt, was ich wissen wollte. Professor Kirin ist also, wie der Junge sagte, fast fertig. Nicht zu verbissen, Kirk. Sie haben noch eine Menge Vorh\u00e4ute nach. Ja, vielleicht trotzdem, glaube ich, dass wir uns viel zu viel Gedanken machen. So lange und gekwentne noch p\u00fcnktlich signalisiert. Es ist gleich ab 11. Oh, das Flutzerflikern hat sich. Das fliegt ja \u00fcber die Insel. Habt ihr sein Zeichen schon gesehen, Kinder? Nein, noch nicht. Muss jeden Moment kommen. Mach schon Vater los. Da. Eins. Zwei. Drei. Alles in Ordnung, George. Nichts passiert. Es ist alles in Ordnung, Tante Fanny. Gut. Jetzt ab ins Weg mit euch. Mach, mach. Puder bin ich aber erleichtert. Aber morgen fr\u00fch werde ich jetzt erst den Turm mit einem Vanglas beobachten. Gute Nacht. Guten Nacht. Nacht. Nacht. Nacht. Puder bin ich aber erleichtert. Aber morgen fr\u00fch werde ich erst den Turm mit einem Vanglas beobachten. Gute Nacht. Gute Nacht. Nacht. Nacht. Nacht. Nacht. Ah. Professor Kirin nehm ich an. Wer zum Teufel sind zu? Ich glaube kaum, dass ich mich kenn' mein Name ist Johnson. Ich bin vom Forschungsministerium. Gott sei Dank, Mr. Johnson. Im ersten Moment habe ich geglaubt, sie lehren zu was wir sagen. Das ist nicht wahr beim Forschungsministerium. Denn k\u00fcrzlich habe ich beschlossen, ein eigenes Ministerium auch zu machen. Verstehen Sie? Und dies ist der Anfang, Professor. Der beste, den ich mir denken kann. Hier auf Kirin Island. Was hinter verbotenen T\u00fcren aufsteckt? Wir kennen kein Zur\u00fcck. Es wird vor uns entdeckt. Wir lassen uns keine Gefahr geht. Wir sind auch nach uns wir packen, san. Wer kann uns wieder stehen? Wir freu mir das. Wir sind auch nach uns. Wir sind auch nach uns. Wir sind auch nach uns. Wir sind auch nach uns.

We don't know them, because we're used to them, where there's always a puzzle to solve, high up in the old castle or Schwoglammess, if that's us. J tummy now I was, solid absurd looking forward to it right now for the Jeste Mille antier short. Endg synagogue youth dealer here zingen Well, how far are you, Mr. Wodjas? Mrs. Kirin is leaving in a minute. Good! Good! Good! Good! Please get ready! And maybe he'll clear your room too, if you should be here any minute. How far is it, Schuheiner? Maybe another mile. Driven 5 miles from the train station. It's unbelievable, we're finally getting away. It's beautiful here, isn't it? Yes, yes, still great. Just look at the sea! That over there must be grain. Oh, it should be a little. What are those from Kuhmenschturm? No idea. But Ginny will definitely know. No, it would be a bit sensuous. Jodjina! Really, Jodjina. Jodjina! Come here! That must be it. Come on! Excuse me! Is this the Kirrenkortage? And how do you know that? We are relatives of Jodjina. Her mother invited us. And in Lausiband Professor Kirrin felled. And three more who swarm around and disturb my work. He has a castle from me, and that is a bit of a Schuhiner. And that is a bit of a Schuhiner. Then he probably built this strange Chopin. What to do with his experiment now? I<|it|> Ah? Be careful and don't get caught up in any of my vegetable gardens! the Bramer, where for older people we don't have theBye-Kan theegyll today? It's nice to see you again though. Specialist Fanny. You are baked here too. Since the last time I saw you. You were still a baby back then. Wait a minute. You should go home and that's fat. How was the trip? Simply brilliant, Aunt Fanny. The journey from the station here was great. OK. I've called a station. Your food is being brought here. Put the drivers behind the house. Tea will be ready soon. You must be hungry too. When legs fall off the bike. But it ends. What was unspoken was that she kept holding her head. It's somehow missing again. I'd say you're baked. And here's a driver. And don't wait. Wonderful afternoon. Yes, I must say, Mr. Johnson. I hope you ate well. What's wrong? There was just a bit too much eating. It's time for a nice cup of office tea. Oh dear. Yes. Miss Peter, I have to go back, but I'm sure my return will be fine without me. We'll let the car go ahead, Miss Peters. Thank you. I thought we'd all go to the island tomorrow and have lunch with Uncle Quentin. Great! Where are Rodinier-Tamte-Fan meet? We've been looking forward to seeing her so much. Which isn't scary. George always disappears when she shouldn't. But what do you call her George? She wants it that way. But then everyone thinks she's a boy and not a girl. Apparently she doesn't want it any other way. I don't want people to think I'm a boy. No, of course not. But you're not like George either. Oh, I hope you show yourself sometimes. We've eaten almost everything. I'm not hungry, mom. Don't you want to say hello? This is End, Dick and Julian. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Why don't you go out with them, George? And show them the area a bit. But I still have to go. Yes, what? What do you have to do? Nothing. Then it's very good. Off you go. I'll clear the table. Thanks for the T\u00e4tente fan. The honey was a lot of fun too, kids. Listen. H\u00fcll. Don't be back too late. No, no. Do you want to be privileged again? Duanshipl. Hocht Britain. Sohr \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0435 October. May on the little expedition. Where everyone can come if they wants. You can try, the cliffs off the island make from your boat. Only father and I know how to get through there. He's there because he needs the tides for his experiments. That's why he's on my island. Well, I think that's great, my own island. Listen. I've got something to do. It's only me, what do you understand. So come on, we're just sneaking after him. None of you. What do you have to do? What can he be funny with you? Well, it's not a big deal for you, but I have to share a room with her. I tell you, that'll be a long time. Can I bring him another one? Why not, if they pay for it, gladly? Oh, we're happier. Please? Thank you. Yes. Jamie! Jamie! Come on, Timmy, come on, come on, come on! Come on, little one, oh, Timmy. That's Quentin Kirin's little one, isn't it? Yes. What's Wiel like as a boy? And most people here just say George to her, cheers. Cheers. That's her dog. The professor didn't want the dog in the house. She should give way, but to the Kirin. That's what you've got there. That's what you've got there. That's what you've got there. That's what you've got there. That's what you've got there. Then you can see if you like it or not.TAKE Japanese we calculate! There are \u9ad8 like theoffs, but and every evening at 11. then you can put your originals. Everyone has their quirks. Isn't it crazy to work so much? Go on! Juan, I like it here! If only John China didn't get mad right away, go on, John here. In the end it has to pay for the ice cream tomorrow. You only say that because I love sofas like that. It looks very lonely. Hey, look! It looks like a big cave is coming here. There's not much to see there. Come on, let's go deeper in. We can't go in without a pocket. Well, let's go back and get one. We've not got time for that. You know what, we'll come back tomorrow and examine it then. Of course, it won't run away from us. Just wait. We'll keep it to ourselves, though, okay? John China's secret here and this cave is only our secret. Okay? Oh, hello, children! You're visiting Karen Cutt now, aren't you? Yes, that's right. Didn't George come with you? No. Oh yes, Uncle and your aunt are good friends of mine. Don't you want to have tea with me tomorrow? Well, I don't know yet what kind of Mo. Well, it doesn't matter, it comes from her funny. I want to be happy. See you again. Strange Couts. That's just the kind of strange people I think. Fanny is the only normal person I've met here so far. Uncle Quentin seems to be a bit strange too. Yes, we'll find out tomorrow when we go over to the island, won't we. Can I brood, George? No, the cliffs feel OK, but off there. That's a bit conclusive. That's a bit conclusive. That's a bit conclusive. That's a bit conclusive. That's a bit conclusive. That's a bit conclusive. That's a bit conclusive. That's a bit conclusive. That's a bit conclusive. That's a bit conclusive. That's a bit conclusive. That's a bit conclusive. That's a bit conclusive. Don't you know a number? What about a roller horn? What about a roller horn? Oh, there are so many parts with you. It's going on the bitchesen stations We look at the wood wars fishing for the water meters. It's going on Montlohen and Roland is now tempting us with burnt tinc. Wait! Is there sound from Penni in the Pantons? No, in the calls comes most of them. George takes the boys with him and see if he catches him. Okay, come on! I wanted to eat you. Wait! Wait! Man, I've never seen anything like it before. Look at that! Tell me, George, do you know what those things are up there on the clay? I could imagine that it has something to do with solar energy. The reflectors or again, that is, maybe they're in a different place. Father! Father! You're not up there. It has to be somewhere. Here I am! Professor K\u00fcrin. Your island seems to be attracting a lot of attention now. You've grown since the last time. That was eight years ago. Oh, really? Then it was to be expected, wasn't it? Where are you hanging out on the island at the moment? In the cellar. In the cellar? Under the ruins, the cellars of the old castle. Tell me, is that your secret laboratory? Yes, you can call it that if you want. Can we have a proper time with you, George? She rowed us out, around the dangerous dams. Wow, she can row. All that in a boy, eh? Now I have to go back. I still have something to check. Thanks for the supplies. George, you can have your island back soon. I'm as good as finished. And who's going to signal me? I'll take care of myself anyway. No, I'll remember. Then make up yourselves. See you again then. No, Siegelsen! You there, you there. A lovely surprise to see you again, K\u00f6rten. Johnson! I suppose you observe rare water birds, don't you? What an excellent Tilliscob. Yes, that's a repurposed telescope. Oh, tell me, who are you working for this time? Russia, China, America? Last time we met, you were very unpleasant to us, K\u00f6rten. I hope you realize that. Listen, I don't work for anyone, I'll give you my word. Your word. If that isn't a radio, I'll drop dead right now. That's enough. Put your little ones in there. There, you wear that. There, sick, kids. George, what are you doing this afternoon? That's my business. I was just thinking, we've found something interesting. What? That's our secret. How did they get to the hill at the end of the beach? You can think about it again. It's really a great thing, what we've found there. George, come on! K\u00f6rten, are you there? What's wrong with you? But I haven't had any information for weeks. I haven't got over any more, you're not going to do business with them again. Hello, Karne. It's nice to hear your voice again. I have the feeling that your activity has entered an unpleasant phase. Bad luck for you. But by the way, one more thing. You won't be able to receive Mr. K\u00f6rten on that frequency anymore. Chances, hear you. We are well aware that you are going to have some trouble. First of all, we are both going to have a thorough talk. I don't think anyone has been here before. You can't even see the end. You have to go awfully far in, come on. This isn't a cave. This is a tunnel that someone else built. It is awfully long. It goes on here until you reach nowhere. What is that? It's a dog. Hey, is it you, Lenn. Heard in Gervor. I don't know, maybe you and someone on the beach. Chimmy. Chimmy, where are you? That's George. I must be hearing something wrong. So that's a great secret. Come on. Chimmy, how many times have I told you not to chase rabbits? Please tell me the secret. Don't you do that to a strange dog? You are a really bad one. Come on now. Do you have to be told everything a thousand times? Hello George. Dick. So what is Timmy? How do you know his name? You just called him. He gave us a big fright. He is really cute. George was yours? Yes. And why haven't we seen him in the house yet? Father forbade me to keep him, but a young Dopp looks after him for me. I'd rather hide than have that get in the way. And besides, Uninen isn't out either. Now I understand that's why you're copying so much. But you don't need to be afraid. We're not telling you a secret. Certainly not, George. Promise me. Yes, we promise. You like us just as much as you do. Yes. Friends? Friends. I didn't like the fact that we were enemies anyway. What I wanted to tell you, George. The tunnel we found isn't a normal tunnel. We didn't get very far, but we found a couple of steps. Yes, they lead straight into the earth. And one way out to the sea. Are you coming with me? Of course, come. Hello, children. Well, what about my invitation? We'd better go before you ask us to look down here. Yes, I'm hungry anyway. Okay, we're coming. Come in. Make yourselves comfortable. And that's yours. Sorry, it's a bit messy. Hand, look at the telescope. Oh, yes, that's my hobby. I'm a bit uneducated. I'm a bit uneducated. I'm a bit uneducated. Hand, look at the telescope. Oh, yes, that's my hobby. I watch birds. Karin Island. Oh, I can see an uneducated storm quite clearly. An adder's snout, a burrowing corax. Rare shorebirds. I spotted a few of them on the island. Yes. And I saw you too, of course. Well, how's your father? My father's here too. He's nearly finished, he said. Ah, is that there? Yes. Good old Quentin. Er, well. Perhaps the more helpful table could thicken. There's some cake and biscuits in there. I'll make it between teas. Not up there. You'll find it all in the bottom drawer, my boy. Oh, sorry. Oh, my goodness. The aunt. I mean my aunt, Aunt Jun. She's coming for tea. Have you forgotten? You know her, I'm sure. Oh yes, of course. Auntie is really lovely. I've said a little sorry to him right away. I'm sorry. Goodbye and thank you very much. I'll look, though. It's really our fault. Excuse me. Thank you very much anyway. Goodbye. Well, maybe another time. Who's Aunt Jun? We don't have an Aunt Jun at all. Of course not, but he said he knew her anyway. He's just pretending he's a friend of Father's. But I never thought of him. You shouldn't have told him Father was nearly finished. You know very well that's a secret. I'm sorry, Jot. I didn't think of it. Don't you think you're exaggerating a bit, Jot? No, I think she's right. You certainly didn't see what was in the cupboard. There was a radio receiver, quite large. Oh man! Really excellent, Kirk. And yes, I'm sorry, I... They left so suddenly. I couldn't ask any questions. I heard everything I wanted to know. So Professor Kirin is, as the boy said, almost finished. Don't be too stubborn, Kirk. They've still got a lot of foreskins left. Yes, maybe even so, I think we're worrying too much. So long and we still signaled on time. It's about 11. Oh, the flood flicker has gone. It's flying over the island. Have you seen its signal yet, children? No, not yet. Should be here any minute. Get rid of Father. There. One. Two. Three. Everything's OK, George. Nothing's wrong. Everything's OK, Aunt Fanny. Good. Now off you go. Go, go. I'm so relieved. But tomorrow morning I'll watch the tower with a van goggles. Good night. Good night. Night. Night. Night. I'm so relieved. But tomorrow morning I'll watch the tower with a van goggles. Good night. Good night. Night. Night. Night. Night. Ah. Professor Kirin, I presume. Who the hell are you? I think I hardly know myself; my name is Johnson. I'm from the Ministry of Research. Thank God, Mr. Johnson. At first I thought they taught us what we say. That's not true at the Ministry of Research. Because recently I decided to set up my own ministry. Do you understand? And this is the beginning, Professor. The best one I can think of. Here on Kirin Island. What's behind forbidden doors? We don't know how to turn back. It will be discovered before we know it. We won't let ourselves be put in danger. We are also after ourselves, we pack up. Who can stand up to us? I'm glad about that. We are also after ourselves. We are also after ourselves. We are also after ourselves. We are also after ourselves. We are also after ourselves. We are also after us. We are also after us. We are also after us. We are also after us. We are also after us. We are also after us. We are also after us. We are also after us. We are also after us. We are also after us. We are also after us. We are also after us. We are also after us. We are also after us. We are also after us. We are also after us."

Und vielleicht r\u00e4umt's doch auch dein Zimmer, ob sie m\u00fcssen jeden Moment hier sein. Wie weit ist es noch, Schuhe? Vielleicht noch eine Meile. Vom Bahnhof aus dem W\u00e4hrendgef\u00e4hrd 5 Meilen gefahren. Ist ja nicht zu laut, endlich geht's mal weg ab. Ist ja auch sch\u00f6n hier, was? Ja, ja, und toll noch. Oh, guckt doch mal das Meer. Das sei dr\u00fcben es bestimmt, K\u00f6rn Einen. Oh ja, m\u00fcsste's einigen. Was sind das von komischer Turm? Keine Ahnung. Aber Ginny wei\u00df das bestimmt. No, es will wollen wenigstens punktlich sein. George! Georgina! Also wirklich, Georgina. Georgina! Komm hier! Das muss es sein. Los! Oh! Entschuldeln Sie bitte. Ist das Ihr Kernkottage? Und wieso bist du das Wissen? Wir sind Verwandte von Georgina. Ihre Mutter hat uns eingeladen. Und die Lausibande hat Professor Kirin noch gef\u00e4llt. Und drei mehr, die herum Wimmeln lernen machen und den bei der Arbeit st\u00f6ren. Er hat verdammt es Gl\u00fcck, dass er meistens auf der Insel ist. Dann hat er wohl diesen komischen Turm gebaut. Ja, etwas mit seinem Experiment zu tun. Ist aber streng geheim klar. Also seht euch vor und blau dort nicht mit fremden Leuten dar\u00fcber. Und last euch ja nicht in einem meiner Gem\u00fcsebieterwischen. Geh \u00fcber bitte, muss ihr \u00e4lter uns denn f\u00fcr Kanickl? Ach, da seid ihr ja. Ist aber sch\u00f6n euch mal wieder zu sehen. Fachpante Fanny. Hier seid ihr auch schon mal ein bisschen Zeit, ich euch das letzte Mal gesehen hab. Endbar damals noch ein Baby. Wartet mal. Du m\u00fcsstest Julian sein und das ist dick. Na wie war die Reise? Einfach klasse, Tante Fanny. Die Fahrt vom Bahnhof hierher war doch prima. Na gut. Ich hab ein Bahnhof angerufen. Euer Gepeck wird hergebracht. Stell die Fahrr\u00e4der hinter's Haus. Gleich gibt's Tee. Wenn Beine vom Rad gefallen. Sondern es endi. Was so sprach, dass sie sich immer den Kopf gehalten hat. Der fehlt irgendwie wieder Mine. Ich w\u00fcrde sagen, dass ihr seit ihr seit ihr seit ihr gekleitet. Wunderbarer nachmittag. Ja, ich muss sagen, Mr. Dunsen. Ich hoffe, sie haben gut gespeistet. Das habe. Es wurde nur ein bisschen zu viel geriert. Es wird Zeit f\u00fcr eine sch\u00f6ne Tasse b\u00fcro Tee. Oh je. Ja. Miss Peters, ich muss umfahre gesehen, aber ich bin sicher, wenn mein R\u00fcckkehr auch ohne mich auskommen. Wir lassen Sie bitte den Wagen vorfahren, Miss Peters. Dankesch\u00f6n. Wir haben uns schon so auf sie gefreut. Was auch nicht fursist. Also George verschwindet immer gerade dann, wenn sie's nicht soll. Aber wie so nennst du sie George? Sie will es so. Aber jeder denkt an sie's ein Junge und kein M\u00e4dchen. Anschein, wer sie's nicht anders. Also ich m\u00f6chte nicht, dass man denkt, ich w\u00e4re ein Junge. Nein, nat\u00fcrlich nicht. Aber du bist ja auch nicht wie George. Ach, dass du dich auch mal sehen l\u00e4sst. Wir haben fast so viel Zeit. Ich bin so viel mehr, wenn ich nicht mehr mehr bin. Ach, dass du dich auch mal sehen l\u00e4sst. Wir haben fast alles aufgegessen. Ich hab keinen Hunger, danke Mutter. Wirst du nicht guten Tag sagen? Das sind End, Dick und Julian. Hallo. Tag. Hallo. Hallo. Warum gehst du nicht mit Ihnen raus, George? Und zeig's Sie ein bisschen die Gegend. Aber ich muss doch noch. Ja, was? Was musst du? Nichts. Dann ist's sehr gut. Also ab mit euch. Ich romm den Tisch ab. Danke f\u00fcr den Tentefenn. Der wohne ich war auch ganz viel Spa\u00df, Kinder. H\u00f6rt mal. Kommt nicht zu sp\u00e4t zur\u00fcck. Nein, nein. Tentefenni hat gesagt, wir wurden auf Anglckwent ins Insel fallen. Du bist das nicht klassischer, Georgina? Mein Name ist nicht Georgina. Ich hei\u00dfe George. Und die Insel geh\u00f6rt nicht ihm, sondern mir. Was riehst du dich denn gleich auf? Sie geh\u00f6rt mir. Er hat sie mir geschenkt. Und jetzt arbeitet ihr da und l\u00e4sst mich \u00fcberhaupt nicht mehr hin. Aber wenn seine Arbeit ein gro\u00dfes Geheimnis ist, warum macht ihr sie dann an einem Ort, wo jeder hinkommen kann, wenn er will? Du kannst es mal versuchen, die Klippen vor der Insel machen aus deinem Boot, Kleinholz. Nur Vater und ich wissen, wie man da durchkommt. Er ist dort, weil die Gezeiten f\u00fcr seine Experimente braucht. Deshalb ist er auf meiner Insel. Also das finde ich auch prima meiner eigenen Insel zuhause. H\u00f6rt mal. Ich hab jetzt was zu erledigen. Das geht nur mich was an verstanden. Also komm, mir blo\u00df nicht hinterher geschlichen. Keiner von euch. Wie haben wir's bei\u00dfes zu tun? Was kann ja lustig werden mit dir? Na f\u00fcr euch ist es ja nicht weiter schlimm, aber ich muss mit ihr in einem Zimmer schlafen. Ich sage euch, das werden bestimmt zwei Verdannplange Wochen k\u00fcrrenz. Darf ich Ihnen noch eins bringen? Warum nicht, wenn Sie es bezahlen gerne? Das sind wir, wir haben vergl\u00fcgen. Bitte? Danke. Jimmy! Jimmy! Komm, Jimmy, komm, nalose, komm! Na komm, mein Kleiner, ach, Jimmy! Das ist die Kleine von Quentin Kirin, nicht wahr? Ja. Wie ist Wielder als ein Junge? Und die meisten hier sagen, nur George zu ihr zum Wohl. Zum Wohl. Das da ist ihr Hund. Der Professor wollte den Hund nicht im Haus haben. Sie sollte im Weg geben, aber an dem K\u00f6ther h\u00e4ngt sie mehr als ein Allmandern. Das ist ein Silvoist-Quentin, ich hab ihn lange nicht mehr gesehen. Hat sich fast v\u00f6llig auf die Insel zur\u00fcckgezogen, experimentiert. Da kommt \u00fcberhaupt nicht mehr r\u00fcber. Seine Frau bringt alles, was er braucht, zur Insel r\u00fcber. Vorher muss er bei mir erst signalisieren, dass alles in Ordnung ist. Dann blinkt er dreimal vom Tour mit einer Taschenlappe. Jeden Morgen und jeden Abend um 11. Danach k\u00f6nnen Sie ihre Urstellen. Jeder hat seinen Marotten. Ist das nicht zur\u00fcck, zu viel zu arbeiten? Los, komm, hier gef\u00e4llt's mir. Wenn sich George innen nur nicht sofort bl\u00f6d ben\u00e4hen wurde, sagt los George zu ihr. Und zuletzt um es muss morgen das Eis bezahlen. Das sagst du nur, weil ich so eine Verliebung. Sieht ja sehr einsam aus. Hey, seht mal. Es sieht aus, als w\u00e4re das eine gro\u00dfe H\u00f6hle. Kommt mal her. Da kann man nicht viel sehen. Kommt wir gehen mal tiefer rein. Wir k\u00f6nnen auch nicht ohne Taschenland bereingehen. Gut, da gehen wir zur\u00fcck und holen uns eine. Daf\u00fcr reicht die Zeit nicht. Wisst ihr was, wir kommen morgen noch mal hier und untersuchen sie dann? Klar, die l\u00e4uft uns ja nicht weg. Bewartet mal. Wir behalten das aber f\u00fcr uns. George hat hier geheimnis und diese H\u00f6hle ist nur unser Geheimnis. Okay? Okay. Oh, hallo Kinder. Ihr seid doch zu Besuch auf Karen Kattetsch nicht wahr? Ja, das stimmt. Ist George nicht mitgekommen? Nein. Oh ja, Uncle und Euretantes sind gute Freunde von mir. Ich habe mir das nicht bei mir Tee trinken. Nein, ja, ich wei\u00df noch nicht, was f\u00fcr Mo. Nein, ja, ist der egal. Kommt von ihr lustig. Ich will mich freuen. Wiedersehen. Komischer Kauts. Das f\u00fcr mich ist nur so von merkw\u00fcrdigen Leuten. Habt ihr Fendi ist der einzige normale Mensch, der mir hier bisher begegnet ist? Onkel Quentin scheint ja wohl auch ein bisschen komisch zu sein. Ja, das werden wir morgen feststellen. Insel nicht wahr? Ja, ob ich rudern, George? Nein, die Glippen f\u00fchlt sich okay, aber abliehen da sie hin. Da sieht sie\u00f1oche aus, dieTO. Diese Blockchain sind sehr komisch daIGN. Wie sollte man nur nicht so weit haben, wenn sie wegh predatorsch sind? Das verurs fing durch, und es realizes und kommt zum \uac71\u7891.

Parece gar nicht so Prayer. Ich hab mal ein bisschen l NARRATORzt in\u00edref close. Und sieht auf jeden Fall. Okay, komm. Ich wollte noch sie essen. Vater! Vater! So was habe ich ja noch nie gesehen. Sieht durch das an. Sag mal, George, wei\u00dft du, was das f\u00fcr Dinger sind da oben am Ton? Ich k\u00f6nnte mir vorstellen, dass das irgendwas mit Sonnenenergie zu tun hat. Die Reflektoren oder wieder, das hei\u00dft, stehen vielleicht beanders. Vater! Vater! Ihr ist v\u00f6llig da oben. Irgendwo muss er doch sein. Hier bin ich. Professor Kirin, Ihre Insel scheint ja ziemlich aufmerksamkeit zu erregen. Prof. Kirin, Ihre Insel scheint ja ziemlich aufmerksamkeit zu erregen. Du bist gewachsen seit dem letzten Mal. Das war vor acht Jahren angek\u00f6nnt. Ach, wirklich? Vater, warst du ja wohl zu erwarten oder was meinst? Wo treibst du dich denn im Moment auf der Insel rum? In den Kellern. In den Kellern? Unter den Ruinen, die Keller vom alten Schloss. Sag mal, ist das dein Geheimelabor? Ja, ja, wenn man viel kann, man ist so nennen. K\u00f6nnt man sich George auch anst\u00e4ndig um euch? Sie hat uns rausgerudert, um die gef\u00e4hrlichen Kleppen rum. Alle Achtung, die kann rudern. Das hei\u00dft, ein Junge, was? So, jetzt muss ich erstmal zur\u00fcck. Ich hab dann auch was zu kontrollieren. Danke f\u00fcr den Nachschub. George, du kannst deine Insel bald zur\u00fcck haben. Ich bin so gut wie fertig. Und wer gehst die Signale nicht? Ich mach mir sonst auch. Nein, ich denke dran. Am Iseht euch noch gut. Also dann. Wiedersehen. Wiedersehen. Sie da, Sie da. Eine reizende \u00dcberraschung, Sie wieder zu sehen, K\u00f6rten. Johnson. Ich nehme an, Sie beobachten seltene Wasserf\u00f6gel nicht wahr? Was f\u00fcr ein hervorragendes Teleskop. Ja, das ist ein ausgeteignetes Fernrohr. Ach so, sagen Sie mir f\u00fcr wen arbeiten Sie denn diesmal? Russland, China, Amerika? Damals, als wir uns das letzte Mal beliegneten, waren Sie f\u00fcr uns sehr unbequen, K\u00f6rten. Ich hoffe, dass Sie sich dar\u00fcber klar sind. Sie ich arbeite f\u00fcr niemanden, ich kippe mit meinen Wort. Ihr Wort. Ach, wenn das kein Funkger\u00e4t ist, will ich sofort tot umfallen. So, das reicht. Legt eure Schwimm\u00f6\u00dfen rein, ja? Ja. So und du tr\u00e4gst das. So, krank, Kinder. George. Was machst du denn heute nachmittag? Das ist ja wohl meine Sache. Ich hab nur gedacht, wer wir was interessantes gefunden haben. Was denn? Das ist unser Geheimnis. Wie sind die den H\u00fcgel am Ende vom Strand? Du kannst es dir noch mal \u00fcberlegen. Es ist wirklich eine tolle Sache, was wir da gefunden haben. Dort, komm! K\u00f6rten, sind Sie da? Was ist los mit Ihnen? Ich habe aber seit Wochen keine Information mehr vor Ihnen bekommen. Ich verstehe Sie nicht, K\u00f6rten, dass Sie mir den wieder Gesch\u00e4fte machen. Hallo, Karne. Ihr Chancen. Wie sch\u00f6n mal wieder Ihre Stimme zu h\u00f6ren. Ich habe das Gef\u00fchl, Ihre T\u00e4tigkeit ist Ihnen dann unangenehm, jetzt Stadion getreten, mein Ver\u00e4rter. Pech f\u00fcr Sie. Auch \u00fcbrigens noch was. Sie werden Mr. K\u00f6rten auf der Frequenz nicht mehr empfangen. Wir sind sich wohl dar\u00fcber klar, dass Sie Unern\u00e4mlichkeiten bekommen. Zuerst einmal werden wir beide uns gr\u00fcndlich unterhalten. Ich glaube, hier ist schon eh nicht keiner mehr gewesen. Man kann nicht mal das Ende sehen. Ihr muss unheimlich weit reingehen, kommt. Das ist keine H\u00f6hle. Das ist ein Tunnel, den um jemand gebaut hat. Der ist ja unheimlich lange. Er geht sich ja weiter bis unschneinz mehr. Was ist denn das? Das ist ein Hund. Hey, wir bist Tunnel. Im Dervor geh\u00f6rt. Keine Ahnung, vielleicht die und jemanden auf Strand. Jimmy, Jimmy, wo bist du? Das ist doch George, ich h\u00f6r wohl nicht richtig. Das ist also ihr tolles Geheimnis. Kommt. Jimmy, wie oft habe ich dir schon gesagt, dass du keine Kaininchen jagen sollst? Sieh mich gef\u00e4lligst an, wenn ich die was sage. Mach dir einen Artigerhund zu was, du bist ein ganz schlimmer. Da kommen jetzt. Muss man dir denn alles tausend, maltank? Hallo, George. Dick, was ist also, Jimmy? Wo wei\u00dft du denn sein Namen? Du hast dir noch gerade gerufen. Der hat uns einen gro\u00dfen Schreck eingehabt. Der ist ja wirklich s\u00fc\u00df, George, geh\u00f6rte dir? Ja. Und warum haben wir noch nicht im Haus gesehen? Vater hat mir verboten, ihn zu behalten, aber ein jungerm Dopp versorgt ihn f\u00fcr mich. Ich w\u00fcrde lieber vorhungen, als das sich im Weg gehen w\u00fcrde. Und au\u00dferdem halt ist Unien auch nicht aus. Ach, jetzt kapiere ich, dass deshalb paust du also so viel ab. Aber du brauchst keine Angst zu haben. Wir verraten ein Geheimnis nicht. Ganz bestimmt nicht, George. Verspricht er mir das? Ja, wir versprechen es. Uns gef\u00e4llt dir doch genauso gut, wie dir. Freunde? Freunde. Ich fand das sowieso nicht gut, dass wir feinde waren. Was ich dir noch sagen wollte, George. Der Tunnel, den wir gefunden haben, das ist kein normaler Tunnel. Sehr weit sind wir nicht gekommen, aber wir haben ein paar Stufen gefunden. Ja, die f\u00fchren direkt in die Erde. Und den Richtung zum Meer raus? Kommst du mit? Na klar, kommt. Hallo, Kinder. Na was ist nur mit meiner Einladung? Gehen wir lieber bevor ihr uns fragt, dass ihr hier unten suchen. Ja, ich hab sowieso Hunger. Okay, wir kommen. Komm rein, mach's euch bequem. Das ist euch. Entschuldig, das ist ein bisschen unaufger\u00e4umtisch. Hensch, seht euch mal das Fernrohr an. Oh ja, das ist mein Hobby. Ich beobachte V\u00f6gel. Caroline. Oh, ich kann ja ungelquenten Sturm ganz deutlich sehen. Eine Arterabend, B\u00fcrokorax. Beseltene K\u00fcstenv\u00f6gel, ein paar davon hab ich auf der Insel ersp\u00e4t. Und euch hab ich nat\u00fcrlich auch gesehen. Na, wie geht es denn deinem Vater? Meinem Vater auch hier. Er ist fast fertig, hatte gesagt. Ah, ist er das? Ja. Der gute alte Quentin. \u00c4h, nun ja. Vielleicht k\u00f6nnte die mir helfen, den Tisch zu denken. Ein bisschen Kuchen und Kekse sind dort drin. Ich mach inzwischen den Tee. Nicht da oben. Du findest alles in dem Unterenfach, mein Junge. Oh, ein Schuldigung. Ach, du meine G\u00fcte. Die Tante. Ich meine, meine Tante, Tante Jun. Sie kommt zum Tee. Habt ihr das vergessen? Sie kennen sie doch sicher. Ja, nat\u00fcrlich. Die Tante ist wirklich erizent. Ich hab ihm ein bisschen leider gleich weg. Tut mir leid. Auf Wiedersehen und vielen Dank. Ich hab aber... Es ist wirklich b\u00fcrt von uns. Entschuldigen Sie bitte. Trotzdem vielen Dank. Auf Wiedersehen. Na ja, dann vielleicht ein Andermal. Wer ist denn Tante Jun? Wir haben \u00fcberhaupt keine Tante Jun. Nat\u00fcrlich nicht, aber trotzdem hat er gesagt, er kennt sie. Der tut nur, soll's w\u00e4re ein Freund von Vater. Aber ich hab den Karl noch niemals vorgesehen. Du h\u00e4ttest ihn nicht sagen d\u00fcrfen, dass Vater fast fertig ist. Du wei\u00dft genau, dass das geheim ist. Ich schiebe mir leid, George. Ich hab mich dran gedacht. Meinst du nicht \u00fcbertreibst die Sachen ein bisschen George? Nein, ich glaub, sie hat recht. Du hast bestimmt nicht gesehen, was in dem Schrank war. Da war ein Funkger\u00e4t, ein ziemlich gro\u00dfes Oh Mann. Wirklich ausgezeichnet, Kurt. Und ja, es tut mir leid, sie waren so pl\u00f6tzlich weg. Ich konnte \u00fcberhaupt keine Fragen stellen. Ich hab alles geh\u00f6rt, was ich wissen wollte. Professor Kehring ist also, wie der Junge sagte, fast fertig. Nicht zu verbissen K\u00f6rten. Sie haben noch eine Menge Vorh\u00e4ute nach. Ja, vielleicht. Trotzdem glaube ich, dass wir uns viel zu viel Gedanken machen. So lange und gekwent die noch p\u00fcnktlich signalisiert. Es ist gleich ab 11. Oh, das fliegt ja \u00fcber die Insel. Habt ihr seinen Zeichen schon gesehen, Kinder? Nein, noch nicht. Muss jeden Moment kommen. Mach schon Vater los. Da. Eins. Zwei. Drei. Alles in Ordnung, George. Nichts passiert. Es ist alles in Ordnung, Tante Fanny. Ich hab's nicht gesehen. Ich hab's nicht gesehen. Ich hab's nicht gesehen. Ich hab's nicht gesehen. Ich hab's nicht gesehen. Ich hab's nicht gesehen. Ich hab's nicht gesehen. Ich hab's nicht gesehen. Ich hab's nicht gesehen. Es ist alles in Ordnung, Tante Fanny. Gut. Jetzt ab ins Weg mit euch. Mach, mach. Puder bin ich aber erleichtert. Aber morgen fr\u00fch werde ich jetzt es den Tom mit einem Fahrenglas beobachten. Guten Nacht. Guten Nacht. Nacht. Nacht. Ah. Professor Kirin, n\u00e4mlich an. Wer zum Teufel sind zu? Ich glaube, kaum, dass ihr mich kennt. Mein Name ist Johnson. Ich bin vom Forschungsministerium. Gott sei Dank, Mr. Johnson. Im ersten Moment hab ich geglaubt, Sie lehren zu was wir sagen. Das ist nicht wahr beim Forschungsministerium. Denn k\u00fcrzlich habe ich beschlossen, ein eigenes Ministerium auch zu machen. Verstehen Sie? Und dies ist der Anfang, Professor. Der beste, den ich schon habe, ist der Anfang, Professor. Der beste, den ich mir denken kann. Hier auf Kirin Island. Was hinter verbotenem T\u00fcren aufsteckt? Wir kennen kein Zur\u00fcck. Es wird vor uns entdeckt. Wir lassen uns keine Gefalle. Wir werden auf uns wir packen. Wir k\u00f6nnen uns wieder stehen. Und Freunde, das sind wir. Zu ihr dich und ich. Ja, schon te mir, der Hund. Und Freunde, das sind wir. Wir kommen schneller bei. Was immer ihr das macht. Wir kommen schneller bei. Was immer ihr das macht. Wir kommen schneller bei. Was immer ihr das macht. Wir kommen schneller bei. Was schon sind wir da. Sind wir da.",
        "translated": "Whenever you make an evening worthwhile, Do you have cupboards? We don't know them, because we're used to them, where there's always a puzzle to solve, high up in the old castle or having a drink, and I think that's us. They're green in there, but golden in their hats, we're whole. We'll come to you later, Herdersaus comes, and we're there. So how far are you, Mr. Wodjas? Mrs. Kirin is leaving shortly. Good! So how far are you, Mr. Wodjas? Mrs. Kirin is leaving shortly. Good! George! George! Please get ready! And maybe you can clear your room too, they should be here any minute. How far is it, shoes? Maybe another mile. We drove 5 miles from the train station. It's not too loud, we're finally getting away. It's lovely here, isn't it? Yes, yes, and great too. Oh, just look at the sea. That's for sure over there, Korn Einen. Oh yes, it should be somewhere. What is that strange tower? I have no idea. But Ginny will definitely know. No, at least it wants to be on time. George! Georgina! Really, Georgina. Georgina! Come here! That has to be it. Go on! Oh! Excuse me. Is this your Kernkottage? And why are you the knowledge? We're relatives of Georgina. Her mother invited us. And Professor Kirin also killed that rascal gang. And three more who are running around and disturbing him at work. He's damn lucky that he's on the island most of the time. Then he must have built that strange tower. Yes, something to do with his experiment. But it's top secret, of course. So be careful and don't talk to strangers about it there. And don't get caught in one of my vegetable gardens. Go over there, please, do you have to be old and stupid? Oh, there you are. It's nice to see you again. Specialist Fanny. You've been here for a while since I last saw you. You were still a baby back then. Wait a minute. You must be Julian and that's fat. How was the trip? Simply brilliant, Aunt Fanny. The journey from the station here was great. OK. I've called a station. Your stuff is being brought here. Put the bikes behind the house. Tea will be ready soon. When legs fall off the bike. But it ends. What said that she kept holding her head. It's somehow missing again. I'd say that you're you are you are you are dressed. Wonderful afternoon. Yes, I must say, Mr. Dunsen. I hope you ate well. I did. There was just a bit too much fuss. It's time for a nice cup of office tea. Oh dear. Yes. Miss Peters, I have to drive around, but I'm sure I'll be able to get by without me when I get back. We'll have the car drive up, please, Miss Peters. Thank you. We were so looking forward to seeing her. Which isn't good. George always disappears just when she shouldn't. But what do you call her George? She wants it that way. But everyone thinks she's a boy and not a girl. Apparently she wouldn't want it any other way. I don't want people to think I'm a boy. No, of course not. But you're not like George either. Oh, I hope you let us see you sometimes. We've got almost as much time. I'll be so much more when I'm no longer there. Oh, I hope you let us see you sometimes. We've eaten almost everything. I'm not hungry, thank you, Mother. Aren't you going to say hello? This is End, Dick and Julian. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Why don't you go out with them, George? And show them the area a bit. But I still have to go. Yes, what? What do you have to do? Nothing. Then it's very good. Off you go. I'll clear the table. Thank you for the tent. The place I live was also a lot of fun, children. Listen. Don't be back too late. No, no. Tentefenni said we would fall into the island on Anglckwent. Aren't you more classic, Georgina? My name is not Georgina. I My name is George. And the island isn't his, it's mine. What are you getting all worked up about? It's mine. He gave it to me. And now you work there and won't let me go any more. But if his work is a big secret, why do you do it in a place where anyone can go if they want to? You can try it, the cliffs in front of the island will turn your boat into splinters. Only father and I know how to get through there. He's there because he needs the tides for his experiments. That's why he's on my island. I think that's great, my own island at home. Listen. I've got something to do now. That's only my business, you understand. So come on, don't sneak up on me. None of you. What are we doing? What could be fun with you? Well, it's not so bad for you, but I have to share a room with her. I'm telling you, that will definitely take two weeks off your vacation. Can I bring you another one? Why not, if you're happy to pay? That's us, we're happy. Please? Thank you. Jimmy! Jimmy! Come, Jimmy, come, come, come! Come, my little one, oh, Jimmy! That's Quentin Kirin's little one, isn't it? Yes. What's Wielder like as a boy? And most people here say, just George, cheers to her. Cheers. That's her dog. The professor didn't want the dog in the house. She was supposed to get in the way, but she's more attached to the dog than a man. That's a Silvoist Quentin, I haven't seen him for a long time. He's withdrawn almost completely to the island, experimenting. Nothing comes over at all. His wife brings everything he needs over to the island. First he has to signal to me that everything is OK. Then he flashes his handkerchief three times from the tour. Every morning and every evening at 11. After that you can do your homework. Everyone has their quirks. Isn't it too much work? Come on, come on, I like it here. If only George didn't feel stupid inside straight away, George said to her. And finally, I'll have to pay for the ice cream tomorrow. You're only saying that because I'm so in love. It looks very lonely. Hey, look. It looks like a big cave. Come on here. You can't see much. Come on, let's go deeper in. We can't go in without a bag. Fine, let's go back and get one. We've not got time for that. You know what, we'll come back here tomorrow and examine it then? Of course, it won't run away from us. Just wait. We'll keep it to ourselves, though. George has a secret here and this cave is only our secret. Okay? Okay. Oh, hello children. You're visiting Karen Kattetsch, aren't you? Yes, that's right. Didn't George come with you? No. Oh yes, Uncle and Euretantes are good friends of mine. I didn't drink tea with me. No, yes, I don't know yet what kind of Mo. No, yes, it doesn't matter. It's funny from her. I want to be happy. See you again. Strange Kauts. That's just from strange people to me. Do you think Fendi is the only normal person I've met here so far? Uncle Quentin seems to be a bit strange too. Yes, we'll find out tomorrow. Island, right? Yes, should I row, George? No, the glippen feels OK, but lie there. That's what it looks like, theTO. These blockchains are very strange daIGN. How can you not have so far when they're gone? That causes caught on, and it realizes and comes to the \uac71\u7891. Since they are seasons end, they-Arsenen, god in the Seong dash the own ring. Northern\ufffdst\u54ea\u5920. So it changes, the real thing is strict. It's not that bad. I've had a little look at the NARRATOR. And it looks good. OK, come on. I wanted to eat it. Father! Father! I've never seen anything like it. It looks through that. Tell me, George, do you know what those things are up there by the clay? I would imagine that it has something to do with solar energy. The reflectors or again, that is, maybe they're in a different position. Father! Father! You're right up there. It has to be somewhere. Here I am. Professor Kirin, your island seems to be attracting quite a bit of attention. Professor Kirin, your island seems to be attracting quite a bit of attention. You've grown since the last time. That was eight years ago. Oh, really? Father, were you to be expected, or what do you think? Where are you hanging out on the island at the moment? In the cellars. In the cellars? Under the ruins, the cellars of the old castle. Tell me, is that your secret laboratory? Yes, yes, when you can do a lot, that's what you call it. Can you look after you properly, George? She rowed us out, around the dangerous cliffs. Wow, she can row. That means a boy, right? Now I have to go back. I have something to check too. Thanks for the supplies. George, you can have your island back soon. I'm as good as finished. And who doesn't take the signals? I usually do it myself. No, I'll think about it. See you all on the I. So then. Bye. Bye. You there, you there. A lovely surprise to see you again, K\u00f6rten. Johnson. I assume you observe rare water birds, don't you? What an excellent telescope. Yes, that is a repurposed telescope. Oh, so tell me who are you working for this time? Russia, China, America? Back when we last met, you were very inconvenient for us, K\u00f6rten. I hope you are clear about that. You, I don't work for anyone, I am swayed by my word. Your word. Oh, if that isn't a radio, I want to drop dead right now. So, that's enough. Put your swimming trunks in, OK? Yes. So, you wear this. So, sick, kids. George. What are you doing this afternoon? That's my business. I was just thinking, we found something interesting. What? That's our secret. How are they on the hill at the end of the beach? You can think about it again. It's really a great thing, what we found there. There, come on! K\u00f6rten, are you there? What's wrong with you? But I haven't had any information from you for weeks. I don't understand you, K\u00f6rten, that you're doing business with me again. Hello, Karne. Your chances. How nice to hear your voice again. I have the feeling that you're uncomfortable with your work, now you've stepped into the stadium, my enraged one. Bad luck for you. And by the way, something else. You won't be able to receive Mr. K\u00f6rten on the frequency anymore. We are well aware that you will be in for a nuisance. First of all, we will both have a thorough talk. I don't think anyone has been here before. You can't even see the end. You have to go awfully far in, come on. It's not a cave. It's a tunnel that someone has built around it. It's awfully long. It goes on until it's almost gone. What is that? It's a dog. Hey, we're in a tunnel. Heard in the forest. I don't know, maybe he and someone on the beach. Jimmy, Jimmy, where are you? That's George, I must be hearing something. So that's their great secret. Come on. Jimmy, how many times have I told you not to chase rabbits? Look at me when I say something. Be a good dog, you're a really bad one. Come on now. Do you have to be told everything, maltank? Hello, George. Dick, what is it, Jimmy? How do you know his name? You just called him. He gave us a big fright. He's really cute, George, was it yours? Yes. And why haven't we seen him in the house yet? Father has forbidden me to keep him, but a young Dopp is taking care of him for me. I would rather starve than that would get in the way. And besides, Unien isn't out either. Oh, now I get it, that's why you're copying so much. But you don't need to be afraid. We're not going to give away a secret. Absolutely not, George. Does he promise me that? Yes, we promise. You like us just as much as you do. Friends? Friends. I didn't like the fact that we were enemies anyway. What I wanted to tell you, George. The tunnel we found isn't a normal tunnel. We didn't get very far, but we found a couple of steps. Yes, they lead straight into the earth. And out towards the sea? Are you coming with me? Of course, come. Hello, children. Well, what about my invitation? We'd better go before you ask us to look down here. Yes, I'm hungry anyway. Okay, we're coming. Come in, make yourselves comfortable. This is yours. Sorry, it's a bit messy. Hensch, take a look at the telescope. Oh yes, that's my hobby. I watch birds. Caroline. Oh, I can see unbroken storms quite clearly. A species evening, office corax. Rare shorebirds, I spotted a few of them on the island. And I saw you too, of course. Well, how's your father? My father here too. He's almost finished, he said. Ah, is that him? Yes. Good old Quentin. Er, well. Perhaps she could help me think of the table. There's some cake and biscuits in there. I'll make the tea in the meantime. Not up there. You'll find everything in the bottom shelf, my boy. Oh, sorry. Oh, my goodness. The aunt. I mean, my aunt, Aunt Jun. She's coming for tea. Have you forgotten? You know her, I'm sure. Yes, of course. The aunt is really keen. I've sent him a bit of a walk, unfortunately. Sorry. Goodbye and thank you very much. But I have... It's really our fault. Please excuse me. Thank you very much anyway. Goodbye. Well, maybe another time then. Who is Aunt Jun? We don't have an Aunt Jun at all. Of course not, but he said he knows her anyway. He's just pretending to be a friend of Father's. But I never thought of Karl. You shouldn't have told him that Father is almost finished. You know very well that it's a secret. I feel sorry for you, George. I thought of it. Don't you think you're exaggerating a bit, George? No, I think she's right. You certainly didn't see what was in the cupboard. There was a radio, a pretty big one. Oh man. Really excellent, Kurt. And yes, I'm sorry they disappeared so suddenly. I couldn't ask any questions. I heard everything I wanted to know. So Professor Kehring is, as the boy said, almost finished. Don't be too stubborn, K\u00f6rten. You still have a lot of foreskins left. Yes, maybe. Still, I think we're worrying too much. So long and we still signaled on time. It's about to start at 11. Oh, that's flying over the island. Have you seen his signal yet, children? No, not yet. Should be here any minute. Let go, Father. There. One. Two. Three. It's all right, George. Nothing's wrong. It's all right, Aunt Fanny. I didn't see it. I didn't see it. I didn't see it. I didn't see it. I didn't see it. I didn't see it. I didn't see it. I didn't see it. It's all right, Aunt Fanny. Good. Now off you go. Do it, do it. I'm relieved, though. But tomorrow morning I'll watch Tom with a driving glass. Good night. Good night. Night. Night. Ah. Professor Kirin, that is. Who the devil are you? I don't think you know me. My name is Johnson. I am from the Ministry of Research. Thank God, Mr. Johnson. At first I thought you were teaching what we were saying. is not true at the Ministry of Research. Because recently I decided to set up my own ministry too. Do you understand? And this is the beginning, Professor. The best one I have yet. The beginning, Professor. The best one I can think of. Here on Kirin Island. What lies behind forbidden doors? We know no turning back. It will be discovered before we know it. We will not accept any favors. We will take care of ourselves. We can stand up again. And friends, that's us. You and me. Yes, take care of me, the dog. And friends, that's us. We'll get there faster. Whatever you do. We'll get there faster. Whatever you do. We'll get there faster. Whatever you do. We'll get there faster. We're already here. We're already here."
