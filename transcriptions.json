        "original": " Once upon a time, you see, In a strange land not far away, I met for chance a little bee, Upon a most unusual day. And when I asked her who she was, she told me, My, ah, no other bee could ever be like you.  Maya, Maya, why you question me? Why is no, no answer for a bee? My, my, she's always in a pretty pickle. Maya, helping someone else's little. Maya, Maya, everyone loves Maya. Maya, Maya, Maya.  Maya, Maya, come tell us what you see.  Oh, hello my friends. As you can see, I'm a grasshopper. My name is Flip. I hope you like me. I know I look funny, but you'll get used to me. I come here often. At the moment, I'm not sure what story to tell you. Nothing interesting has happened to me today at all. I think the life of a grasshopper can be very boring. Eating grass all the time and hopping about isn't very exciting, although I do like eating. I'm bored.  I wish that butterfly there was my friend. There's a swarm of bees coming along. Back from gathering honey. They're such hard-working little fellows. I really think they work too hard. They always fly in a swarm. Hello. Hello, my friends. Hello. Did you collect a lot of honey today? I'd be so happy if you'd give me a drop. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.  Not even time to say hello. How unfriendly they are. They make me drop my hat. Oh. Ah. I wonder why I know it's dead back so early. They usually stay away much longer. Something must be wrong. I wonder what is happening. All this buzzing about, it's most unusual. Perhaps we're in luck and something exciting is going to happen. Hello, little creepy crawly. Are you going for a walk?  a walk? I wonder if he can talk. No, I don't think he can talk. He's still too young. He's just like a baby. All he does is open his mouth. I think he must be hungry. I know. There must be trouble in the beehive. It's on the other side of the ruined castle behind the big pine tree. A fine, safe place. I'll jump down and go and see.  Hmm? What's the matter? Why don't you let me in? Don't know who I am? If you don't know the password, you can't come in. Of course you know me. I'm Cassandra. I was your teacher when you were at school. Cassandra?  Cassandra! Today's a great hatching day. If you don't let me in, all the little bees will die. You should have a good look at people before you say you don't know them. We're so sorry, but you know we've got rules to obey. Lots of people try to get in here and make trouble, and we're in charge here. You ought to have enough sense to change the rules at an important time like this. Don't you ever think first, you silly boy? He didn't know it was so important. Can I come in now? Yes, all right, Cassandra. Fly in. Yes, yes.  Here I am at last. We've been waiting a long time. They might hatch out any moment now. They're coming. Let's help them.  Stay where I put you.  How do I get out of here? I wonder if there's a door somewhere. Oh, dear. Hear that? That's Maya. I'll just have to break it open. Hello. Anyone at home?  Yes, Maya. We've been waiting for you. You're the last one to come out. And who is Maya? Am I Maya? Why did you call me Maya? Tell me, please. Well, actually, there's no real reason. Everybody's got to have a name. Oh, have you got a name? Yes, I'm Cassandra. I'll look after you till you're big. Come on.  I'm glad I'm out. It was hot inside. It's your own fault. The others came out long ago. What made you wait so long? I had a beautiful dream. A dream? But Maya bees never dream. Perhaps someday I'll tell you what I dreamt. It was such fun. What happens now? Shall I jump or are you coming to fetch me? Wait. I'll fetch you. Don't worry. You're quite safe. Come along. Your life is just a dream.  It's beginning and there's so much to learn. Oh, what are they doing? They're learning to fly in a swarm. Swarm? What's that? We bees always fly in a swarm. I don't understand. It's a little difficult to understand. I'll teach you easier things first. I hope so. And why do they do that? We bees have done that ever since we began a long time ago. And why do bees do this? Why don't you tell me, Miss?  Cassandra, I want to know why. How am I ever going to learn anything about life if you won't tell me about things? Be patient, Maya. I can't explain everything to you at once. Come, let's join the others. All right. And in the comb they put the eggs. Why do they do that? The eggs line the comb like bird's eggs in their nest, and after a few weeks of  little bees hatch, just as you did. Was I in an egg like that? Yes, you were. Watch how they put an egg in each little hole, and then another bee comes and shuts it tight with wax. They are the worker bees. They only work inside the hive. They build the hive and look after the eggs. They're very busy, for the queen lays a lot of eggs every day. I don't suppose you can remember when you were a queen bee.  You were inside an egg, do you? Goodness! What is that child up to now? Oh! So heavy! I've managed it! Oh, there you are!  See, Miss Cassandra, I can do it as well. Good, but only one egg in each hole. But why? If there were two eggs together, they could talk to each other. They wouldn't be so lonely, would they? Maya, we bees weren't born to spend our days talking. We were born to work. I worry about you. You really have such funny ideas in your little head. I like my idea, two eggs instead of one. My dear Maya, experience has proved that one egg is better.  But why is it better? We could make much bigger combs for bigger eggs. Come along. Let's get along. Oh, that smells good. What is it? I'm hungry. It is good. That's honey that you can smell.  Why can't I move this as the others can?  Leave that. It's too heavy for you. Is that all honey? Yes. We store the honey for the winter in here. Hmm. Maya, come back here at once. Oh, it's lovely, Miss Cassandra. Oh, oh, oh! Oh, oh, oh!  Goodness, you are a naughty child. What a mess you're in, Maya, really. Honey, it tastes nice, but it's so sticky... Come along. School is beginning. ...as I move my wings. Now you're old enough, I'm going to take you on a trip to the outside world to see the sky. Miss Cassandra, will you...  Would you please tell me what the sky is? I want to know. Just wait until we get there, then I'll explain everything to you. But don't think it's all fun out there. Little bees aren't allowed out there on their own. Do you understand? Oh. Huh? It's dangerous out there. You must understand how wicked it is and be very careful. Yes, I know that, Miss Cassandra, because I've been in this class for two years already. Then you should know that this is a wasp and they're our worst enemies. They're ten times bigger than we are, so be very careful.  careful of them. There's no need to be afraid. Now get back to your seats. There are no wasps inside the hive. They can't get in. So you really needn't be scared at all, my little ones. This is a frog. Never fly too low over water because that's what might happen. He's got a very long tongue. Don't worry. A frog can never get in here. And Cassandra, does that mean we must never, never go near  where there are any frogs. Correct, Willie. Don't forget. Are you Willie? Yeah, I'm Willie. You seem to be very clever. No, it's just that I've heard this lesson for years. Well, I am Maya. Have you heard about me? Yes, but only terrible things. You ask people so many questions, they want to scream. The world can be a very cruel place. For example, when it rains, it isn't at all nice. When that happens, come back home or hide under a leaf. No!  it's raining outside, what's the best thing for a little bee to do? Will he? Do you know? Well, he should stay at home. What would happen if he didn't stay at home, Miss Cassandra? My dear child, I've just told you. What's that terrible noise? Please stay at your desks. I'll be back very soon. What's the matter? I wonder what's happening. Something must be wrong. Am I?  Maya, Maya, where are you going? Come back. I'm going outside. No, Maya, Maya, come back. It isn't safe to go outside. What are you doing? Give it to me.  Stop whining. It belongs to Miss Cassandra. Oh, my goodness. Where does this voice come from? You be quiet. Someone's coming. What's going on here? Stop crying. It's not so bad. You others keep quiet. Willie, you and the others keep order here.  You heard what he said. I'm in charge. You must do as I say. Look! A horse! That's not a real one. It's the one we saw before. It's only a picture. But since I'm in charge, I'll show you something else.  This is a spider, isn't he ugly? He's dangerous too. I saw a real one. Her name was Martha and you know what? She played the fiddle. No, it isn't. This is a dandelion. Oh, even a teacher can make a mistake.   There's a strong wind blowing outside, and it isn't at all nice. The sky isn't blue anymore. Miss Cassandra said it was beautiful. The sky isn't blue anymore.  I wonder what flower that is. What's going on in here? Oh, Miss Cassandra! Willie, what are you doing here? Didn't I tell you all to stay at your desks and keep quiet? I was. Thank you, Willie. Now you go back to your desk, too. Maya, can you tell me what this is? Oh, where is she?  Does anybody know where she is? Did anybody see her going out? Yes, I saw her going out. I know exactly where she's gone. She wanted to see the storm. Oh, no! What a naughty child she is. I have to watch her all the time, the silly girl. The world is looking beautiful again. Oh, there's that funny little blue man again.  come on out give me your hand and dance with me sing with me jump with me sing and play and have some fun and laugh with me come on out give me your hand right now wow  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la La-la-la-la-la-la-la La-la-la-la-la-la-la Like a carousel I turn around and round Round and round  Round and round, one and one and two and three, such fun with me. Turn around, I'll show you why. You will understand. This is wonderful. When we dance, the trees and flowers spin around. Come on now, give me your hand and dance with me.  with me, sing with me, jump with me, sing and play and have some fun with me, come and dance, jump with me.  Left leg up and right leg up and dance with me. One, two, three. Like a carousel we go round and round. Round and round. Round and round. Come and have some fun with me. Very, very good. Maya, Maya.  Maya, where are you? Maya, where are you? Maya, answer me at once. It's your teacher, Miss Cassandra. Maya, where are you? Maya. I saw it happen. I'm telling you. You're always in luck. What's wrong? Have you seen a little bee? If you're looking for that naughty little girl, she's over there. Let her stay there for a few minutes and learn a good lesson. Maya! Is that you, Miss Cassandra? I should sting you now. Now that you're trapped.  You've been very naughty, Maya. I'm going to have to punish you and send you to bed straight away. Oh, I didn't do anything bad. I just wanted to explore. It doesn't matter. You caused me a lot of trouble. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And don't go exploring again. Yes, I'm sorry. Okay. Now, just lie there quiet.  and go to sleep. Oof. Why is it naughty of me to want to see the outside world? Next time I'll be clever and run away when nobody's looking. Then they'll never find me. This was our first story about bees. I hope you'll be watching next time because if you are, I'll tell you a little secret. Secret?  Next time we meet, you'll see how big Maya has grown. She's ready to learn to fly, but not alone. Miss Cassandra is with her to see that she keeps out of trouble. Bye-bye. Be seeing you.  \u00a9 BF-WATCH TV 2021  \u00a9 BF-WATCH TV 2021",

Porqu\u00ea que n\u00e3o me diz, professora Cassandra? Quero saber porqu\u00ea! Como \u00e9 que vou aprender alguma coisa sobre a vida se a senhora n\u00e3o me explica? Seja paciente, m\u00e3e. Eu n\u00e3o te posso explicar tudo de uma vez. V\u00e1, vamos ter com as outras. Ah! E dentro dos favos colocam-se os ovos. E porqu\u00ea que fazem isso? Os ovos ficam dentro de favos e passadas algumas semanas...  Nasce uma abelhinha, como aconteceu contigo. Estive num ovo igual \u00e0quelas? Se veste. V\u00ea como elas colocam um ovo em cada buraquinho. Depois vem outra abelha que fecha o orif\u00edcio com cera. S\u00e3o as obreiras, que s\u00f3 trabalham dentro da colmeia. S\u00e3o elas que constroem a colmeia e tomam conta dos ovos. Tenham sempre muito o que fazer, pois todos os dias a abelha-mestra p\u00f5e um grande n\u00famero de ovos. N\u00e3o me parece que te lembra?  Lembres-te como era quando estavas dentro do ovo, pois n\u00e3o? Onde \u00e9 que estar\u00e1 aquela mi\u00fada? \u00c9 pesado. Consegui! Ah, est\u00e1s a\u00ed!  Est\u00e1 a ver, professora Cassandra, eu tamb\u00e9m consigo \u00d3timo, mas \u00e9 s\u00f3 um ovo por cada buraquinho Mas porqu\u00ea? Se os ovos ficassem aos pares, podiam falar uns com os outros Assim j\u00e1 n\u00e3o se sentiam t\u00e3o sozinhos Maia, n\u00f3s as abelhas n\u00e3o nascemos para conversar, nascemos para trabalhar Estou muito preocupada contigo, tens umas ideias muito estranhas nessa cabecinha Eu gosto da minha ideia, dois ovos em vez de um Minha querida Maia, a experi\u00eancia prova que \u00e9 melhor um s\u00f3 ovo Sim  Mas diga-lhe porqu\u00ea que \u00e9 melhor Faz\u00edamos divis\u00f5es maiores para mais ovos Anda, vamos l\u00e1 Ah, que bem que cheira Que fome E \u00e9 mesmo bom, o cheiro que est\u00e1s a sentir \u00e9 do mel  Por que n\u00e3o consigo levantar isto como fazem as outras?  Deixa isso, \u00e9 muito pesado para ti Isto \u00e9 mel? Sim, \u00e9 aqui que armazenamos o mel Maya, volta aqui j\u00e1! Isto \u00e9 delicioso!  \u00c9s mesmo endiabrada Ficaste toda suja, Maia O mel sabe bem Mas \u00e9 t\u00e3o pegajoso que n\u00e3o consigo mexer as asas Agora que j\u00e1 s\u00e3o mais crescidos Vou lev\u00e1-los numa viagem ao mundo exterior para verem o c\u00e9u Pronto  Professora Cassandra, pode dizer-me o que \u00e9 o c\u00e9u? Gostava de saber. Espera at\u00e9 l\u00e1 chegarmos. Depois explico-te tudo. Mas n\u00e3o penses que o mundo l\u00e1 fora \u00e9 s\u00f3 divers\u00e3o? As abelhas pequeninas n\u00e3o podem andar l\u00e1 fora sozinha, percebeste? O mundo l\u00e1 fora \u00e9 perigoso. Tenho de perceber como \u00e9 cruel e ter muito cuidado. Sim, eu sei, professora Cassandra. Eu j\u00e1 ando nesta aula h\u00e1 dois anos. Ent\u00e3o deves saber que isto \u00e9 uma vespa e que h\u00e1 inimigos ainda piores, dez vezes maiores do que n\u00f3s.  Tenham muito cuidado com eles N\u00e3o tenham medo, voltem para os vossos lugares N\u00e3o h\u00e1 vespas dentro da colmeia Elas n\u00e3o podem entrar, por isso n\u00e3o precisam de ter medo nenhum, minhas pequeninas Isto \u00e9 uma r\u00e3 Nunca voem muito baixo sobre a \u00e1gua Sen\u00e3o isto \u00e9 o que pode acontecer Elas t\u00eam uma l\u00edngua muito comprida N\u00e3o se preocupem, as r\u00e3s nunca poder\u00e3o entrar aqui Ah, professora Cassandra \u00c9?  Isso quer dizer que nunca nos devemos aproximar das r\u00e3s. Isso mesmo, Willy. N\u00e3o se esque\u00e7am. Tu \u00e9s o Willy? Sim, sou o Willy. Parece ser muito esperto. N\u00e3o, eu j\u00e1 ando nesta aula h\u00e1 dois anos. Bem, eu sou a Maya. J\u00e1 ouviste falar de mim? Sim, mas s\u00f3 coisas terr\u00edveis. Fa\u00e7o tantas perguntas \u00e0s pessoas que lhes d\u00e1 vontade de gritar. O mundo pode ser muito cruel. Por exemplo, quando chove n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada agrad\u00e1vel. Quando isso acontecer, voltem para casa ou escondam-se debaixo de uma favela.  Se estiver a chover l\u00e1 fora, qual \u00e9 a melhor coisa que uma abelha pode fazer? Queres ser tu a responder, Willy? Bem, devemos ficar em casa O que \u00e9 que aconteceria se n\u00e3o fic\u00e1ssemos em casa, professora? Eu acabei de vos dizer, querida Que barulho \u00e9 este? Por favor, n\u00e3o saiam dos vossos lugares, eu volto j\u00e1 O que \u00e9 que estar\u00e1 a acontecer? Deve haver algum problema Maia, Maia  Maia, onde \u00e9 que vais? Volta! Volta aqui! Vou l\u00e1 fora! N\u00e3o, Maia! Maia, volta! N\u00e3o \u00e9 seguro ir l\u00e1 para fora O que \u00e9 que est\u00e3o a fazer? Toma! Toma! Toma!  \u00c9 meu! N\u00e3o, n\u00e3o \u00e9! \u00c9 meu! Isso \u00e9 da professora Cassandra! N\u00e3o \u00e9! Tudo \u00e9 que vejo este pote. O que \u00e9 que se passa aqui? Pronto, n\u00e3o chores mais, minha pequenina. Willie, tu \u00e9s o mais velho. V\u00ea l\u00e1 se imp\u00f5es alguma obra.  A ordem. Voc\u00eas ouviram o que eu disse? Eu \u00e9 que sou o respons\u00e1vel. Fa\u00e7am o que eu digo. Olha, \u00e9 uma vespa. N\u00e3o \u00e9 uma vespa a s\u00e9rio. \u00c9 aquela que vimos antes. \u00c9 s\u00f3 uma figura. Mas j\u00e1 que sou o respons\u00e1vel, vou-lhes mostrar outra coisa.

Voc\u00eas deviam estar sossegadinhos e a estudar Obrigada, Willy Podes voltar para o teu lugar Maia, \u00e9s capaz de me dizer o que \u00e9 isto?  Mas onde \u00e9 que ela est\u00e1?

        "translated": "The story I'm going to tell Is full of magic and color And a bee will talk About nature and its splendor I asked her if her name was Maia In a world without equal fame Music Maia, what else to change Hello, friends! As you can see, I'm a grasshopper My name is Philip, I hope you like me I know I'm weird, but where do you get used to it? I come here often I don't know what story to tell you Nothing interesting has happened to me today It seems to me that the life of a grasshopper can be very boring Spending the day eating grass and hopping from one place to another isn't very exciting Although I like to eat Oh, yes I wish the butterfly were my friend Ana, come to me, I call you bees. They bring honey. Those little ones are so hard-working that I think they even work too much. They always fly to us, Allah! Did you collect a lot of honey today? Give me a little drop. It's really theirs, always busy. all day long. They don't even have time to say hello. How unusual. I even dropped my hat. Oh! Oh? Ha! Why are they back so early? They usually take much longer. But why? What's going on? This hubbub is not at all common. Maybe we'll get lucky and something interesting will happen. Hello, little worm. Are you going for a walk? Can you talk? No, I don't think she can talk. She's still very young. All she can do is open her mouth. She must be hungry. I know! There must be trouble in the hive. It's on the other side of the ruined castle, behind that big pine tree. It's a nice, safe place. What's going on? Why won't you let me in? You don't know who I am If you don't know the password, you can't come in I don't need a password, I'm Cassandra She was your teacher when you were in school Oh! Pedro? Finally We've been waiting for a long time They must be almost hatching Here they come, come on! They don't leave here. How do I get out of here? Is there a door here? It's Maia I'll have to break it Hello Is anyone home? Yes, Maia We've been waiting here for you You were the last one born Who is it, Maia? It's me, Maia Why did you call me Maia? Tell me, please Well, there's no special reason really Everyone has a name Do you have a name too? Yes, my name is Cassandra Take care of you until you grow up Come here Let's go I'm glad you invited me, it's hot It's your fault, the others left a long time ago Why did you take so long? I had a beautiful dream A dream? But, Maia, bees never dream Maybe one day I'll tell you my dream, it was so much fun Well, should I jump or will Dona Cassandra come and get me? Wait, I'll go and get you Calm down Open up Open up Life is just beginning and there is so much to learn. Oh! What are they doing? They are learning to live in a swarm. A swarm? What is that? Bees always fly in a swarm. Why? It is a little difficult to understand. First I will teach you some easier things. Why do they do that? We bees have been doing this since the beginning of time. And why do bees do that? Why? Why don't you tell me, Professor Cassandra? I want to know why! How am I going to learn anything about life if you don't explain it to me? Be patient, Mom. I can't explain everything to you at once. Come on, let's go and see the others. Ah! And the eggs are laid inside the honeycomb. And why do they do that? The eggs are laid inside the honeycomb and after a few weeks... A little bee is born, just like you. Have you been in an egg like those? Get dressed. See how they lay an egg in each little hole. Then another bee comes along and seals the hole with wax. They are the workers, who only work inside the hive. They are the ones who build the hive and take care of the eggs. They always have a lot to do, because every day the queen bee lays a large number of eggs. Don't you think that reminds you? Remember what it was like when you were inside the egg, don't you? Where is that little girl? It's heavy. I got it! Oh, there you are! You see, Professor Cassandra, I can do it too. Great, but it's only one egg for each little hole. But why? If the eggs were in pairs, they could talk to each other. That way they wouldn't feel so alone. Maia, we bees weren't born to talk, we were born to work. I'm very worried about you. You have some very strange ideas in that little head of yours. I like my idea, two eggs instead of one. My dear Maia, experience proves that one egg is better. Yes. But tell him why it's better We'd make bigger divisions for more eggs Come on, let's go Ah, how good it smells How hungry And it's really good, the smell you're feeling is honey Why can't I lift this like the others do? Leave it, it's too heavy for you. Is this honey? Yes, this is where we store Maya honey, come back here right now! This is delicious! You're really mischievous You got all dirty, Maia The honey tastes good But it's so sticky that I can't move my wings Now that they're older I'm going to take them on a trip to the outside world to see the sky Ready Professor Cassandra, can you tell me what heaven is? I'd like to know. Wait until we get there. I'll explain everything to you later. But don't you think that the outside world is just fun? Little bees can't go out alone, do you understand? The outside world is dangerous. I have to understand how cruel it is and be very careful. Yes, I know, Professor Cassandra. I've been in this class for two years. So you must know that this is a wasp and that there are even worse enemies, ten times bigger than us. Be very careful with them Don't be afraid, go back to your places There are no wasps inside the hive They can't get in, so you don't need to be afraid at all, my little ones This is a frog Never fly too low over the water Otherwise this is what can happen They have a very long tongue Don't worry, frogs will never be able to get in here Oh, Professor Cassandra Is that so? That means we should never go near frogs. That's right, Willy. Don't forget. Are you Willy? Yes, I'm Willy. You seem very smart. No, I've been in this class for two years. Well, I'm Maya. Have you heard of me? Yes, but only terrible things. I ask people so many questions that they want to scream. The world can be very cruel. For example, when it rains, it's not pleasant at all. When that happens, go home or hide under a shanty. If it's raining outside, what's the best thing a bee can do? Do you want to answer that, Willy? Well, we should stay home. What would happen if we didn't stay home, teacher? I just told you, dear. What's that noise? Please stay where you are, I'll be right back. What's going on? There must be something wrong, Maia, Maia. Maia, where are you going? Come back! Come back here! I'm going outside! No, Maia! Maia, come back! It's not safe to go outside. What are you doing? Take it! Take it! Take it! It's mine! No, it's not! It's mine! That's Professor Cassandra's! It's not! All I see is this pot. What's going on here? There, don't cry anymore, my little one. Willie, you're the oldest. See if you can impose some work. The order. Did you hear what I said? I'm the one in charge. Do what I say. Look, it's a wasp. It's not a real wasp. It's the one we saw before. It's just a figure. But since I'm the one in charge, I'll show you something else. This is a spider Really ugly And also dangerous I've seen a real one Its name was Marta and it was really bad That's a lie No, it's not This is a dandelion It's nothing It doesn't need anything Go away No, no What should I do? Such a strong wind is blowing outside It's really not pleasant The sky is no longer blue Teacher Cassandra said it was blue So this is it. Pass it here. Oh, teacher Cassandra Willy, but what are you doing? You should be quiet and studying. Thank you, Willy. You can go back to your place. Maia, can you tell me what this is? But where is she? Can anyone tell me where she is? Did anyone see her leave? Yes, teacher, I saw her leave I know exactly where she went She went to see the storm What a naughty child I have to keep an eye on that girl The world is beautiful again How funny that little green bug How funny that little green bug WE ARE AT HAND There, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there. Like a celestial chariot always turning. Oh! Spinning, always spinning One and two and three with me is fun Turn around and you'll see You'll understand This is a pleasure When we dance the flowers spin In the wind Give it to mom right there Come dance with me, sing with me, jump with me. Sing, play, have fun with me. Come dance, jump with me. Come, wake up, come dance and laugh with me One, two, three Like a car in the sky I'm always spinning Always spinning Spinning Come, you'll see it's fun Very good, very good! Maya! Maia, where are you, Maia? Where are you? Answer immediately It's Cassandra, your teacher Maia, where are you? Maia, Maia Now everything is resolved You always get yourself into trouble Have you seen a little bee? If you're looking for that cheeky girl, it's over there Let her stay there for a few minutes and see if she learns her lesson Maia It's the teacher Cassandra She should take advantage of the fact that you're in jail to stab you Sting! You were very naughty, Maia. I'm going to have to punish you and send you to bed right now. Oh, but I didn't do anything wrong. I just wanted to see the storm. It doesn't matter. You caused a lot of trouble. I apologize. And don't go out exploring the world again. Okay. I apologize. Go. Let me see. Stop standing there quietly and get some sleep. Why am I being naughty just for wanting to see the world outside? Next time I'll be smarter and run away when no one's looking. They'll never find me."

Un bosquecito de abedules, avellano, rosa de azafr\u00e1n. Adelante. Unos arvitos de jugo de plantas. Por las ma\u00f1anas es un placer delicioso. Buenos d\u00edas, se\u00f1oras. \u00bfTrabajando tan temprano? No, las v\u00edas a\u00e9reas est\u00e1n muy...  ocupadas esta ma\u00f1ana por lo que veo. \u00a1Oh, claro! Una abeja reina. Por eso hay tanto jaleo. Las abejas est\u00e1n de fiesta.  Oh!  \u00a1Vamos! \u00a1Vamos! \u00a1Vamos! \u00a1R\u00e1pido! \u00a1R\u00e1pido! \u00a1Los panales se est\u00e1n derritiendo! \u00a1Vamos! \u00a1Todo el mundo a los panales! \u00a1Que se est\u00e1 saliendo la miel! \u00a1Vamos! \u00a1Vamos! \u00a1Vamos! \u00a1R\u00e1pido!  \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 gritan tanto? \u00a1Eh, Willy! \u00a1Espera! \u00bfQu\u00e9 est\u00e1s haciendo aqu\u00ed, Willy? Pues lo mismo que los dem\u00e1s, agitando mis alas. \u00a1Qu\u00e9 tonter\u00eda! \u00bfPara qu\u00e9? Vaya, har\u00e9 como si no hubiera o\u00eddo eso. Hab\u00eda desesperado.  demasiadas abejas en la colmena, demasiado calor y ten\u00edan que enjambrar. Ahora lo que tenemos que hacer es crear una corriente de aire. Cuando hace demasiado calor, la cera se derrite en los panales y los huevos y las larvas se mueren, \u00bfentiendes? \u00a1Eh, Maya! \u00bfA d\u00f3nde vas? Qu\u00e9date aqu\u00ed, a\u00fan no vamos a aprender a volar. Ya lo s\u00e9, pero cuando muevo mis alas no puedo evitarlo.  I'm sorry.  \u00a1Bien! \u00a1Bien! \u00a1Aj\u00e1! \u00a1Aj\u00e1! Bueno, lo han hecho otra vez. Creo que est\u00e1n un poco chifladas. Bueno, a m\u00ed me da lo mismo. En mi peque\u00f1o agujero en la tierra la temperatura es agradable, pero ellas tienen que construir una colmena con miles y miles de habitaciones. \u00a1No, vaya! \u00a1Silencio en el \u00faltimo banco! \u00a1Silencio en el \u00faltimo banco!  siempre al acecho en la oscuridad. Por eso una abeja no debe nunca salir de la colmena por la noche, no lo olvid\u00e9is. Se\u00f1orita, \u00bfpuedo hacer una pregunta? S\u00ed, \u00bfqu\u00e9 es, Maya? \u00bfCu\u00e1ndo podremos salir por fin de aqu\u00ed y volarnos? La prometida hace ya m\u00e1s de una semana. Exactamente. Un viejo proverbio dice, la experiencia es la madre de la ciencia. No seas tan impertinente. Cuando llegue la hora, saldr\u00e9is a volar. \u00bfY cu\u00e1ndo llegar\u00e1 esa hora, eh? Y adem\u00e1s, \u00bfqu\u00e9 quiere decir con eso de cuando llegue la hora? Quiero decir que ser\u00e1 esta misma tarde.  \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya! Maya va a volar, Maya va a volar. Ahora Maya va a volar. Ahora Maya va a volar, va a volar. \u00a1Maya! Lo siento. \u00bfNo puedes mirar por donde vas? Es que estoy muy nerviosa. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 me van a dejar volar por primera vez? Es estupendo. \u00bfY sabes una cosa? Volar\u00e9 directamente hacia el sol. \u00a1Maya va a volar! \u00a1Maya!  Yo recuerdo muy bien mi primer vuelo. Dios m\u00edo, hace tanto tiempo ya. No os queremos enga\u00f1ar. Ahora vamos a volar, a volar, a volar. \u00a1Alto, alto! Es a m\u00ed. Dime, \u00bft\u00fa eres Willy, eh? No, yo soy Maya. Oh, pensaba que eras Willy. Anda, sigue, sigue, vete. \u00bfQu\u00e9 es lo que pasa con Willy? Nada, nada, t\u00fa sigue, peque\u00f1a. Vale, vale.  \u00a1Ah! \u00a1Ah! Bueno, \u00bfest\u00e1s aqu\u00ed? Cre\u00ed que estabas deseando volar. Y lo estoy. Pero antes ten\u00eda que contar a todo el mundo que hoy voy a volar por primera vez. \u00a1He cepillado mis alas! \u00a1Mire, mire c\u00f3mo brillan! Vamos, ni\u00f1os, empecemos. \u00a1Qu\u00e9 bien!  Quiz\u00e1s est\u00e9 un poco bajo, \u00bfno crees? Vamos, Maya, int\u00e9ntalo t\u00fa. Muy bien. \u00a1Socorro, socorro, socorro! \u00a1Ay, que me caigo! Eso pasa siempre que se quiere volar demasiado alto. \u00a1Qu\u00e9 raro! Aqu\u00ed falta alguien. \u00bfNo est\u00e1 Willy? \u00bfNo? \u00a1Qu\u00e9 gracioso! \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no se ha venido con nosotros a clase?  \u00bfSabe por qu\u00e9 no est\u00e1 aqu\u00ed, se\u00f1orita? Puede que est\u00e9 enfermo. Ah. \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya! Vete con los dem\u00e1s y no se ir\u00e1n  volando. Ya se han ido, Willy. \u00bfQu\u00e9? \u00bfEntonces por qu\u00e9 has vuelto? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9? Porque no ten\u00eda ganas de volar. Eso no es cierto. No me enga\u00f1es. Estabas loca por volar. Mucho m\u00e1s que nosotros. Es por mi culpa, P\u00eda. Por m\u00ed te has quedado atr\u00e1s. Porque yo no puedo volar por eso. No es verdad. \u00bfNo te has quedado aqu\u00ed por m\u00ed? \u00bfY qu\u00e9 importa por lo que me haya quedado? \u00bfNo quieres que te lea un cuento? Lo sab\u00edas, \u00bfverdad?  \u00bfSab\u00edas que yo ten\u00eda miedo a volar? Porque no s\u00e9 y por eso has vuelto. \u00bfQu\u00e9 idea se te mete en la cabeza? No es que me imagine que no s\u00e9 volar, es que no s\u00e9. El viejo proverbio de las abejas tiene raz\u00f3n. Un amigo es el m\u00e1s preciado tesoro. Parece que las abejitas hacen su primera salida hoy. No veo a Maya con ellas. A lo mejor la han encerrado otra vez. \u00bfQu\u00e9?  Siento curiosidad por saberlo. Preguntar\u00e9 a la se\u00f1orita Casandra. Esto lo va a hacer mirar dos veces, se\u00f1ora. Nosotros los saltamontes somos unos tipos inteligentes. \u00a1Qu\u00e9 mala educaci\u00f3n! \u00a1Dando saltos mortales cuando se est\u00e1!  hablando con una dama. \u00a1Ay, usted no me comprende, mi querida se\u00f1ora! Yo tengo la sangre ardiente y mucho temperamento, mucho temperamento, \u00f1a, \u00f1a, \u00f1a, \u00f1a. \u00a1Ay, nuestra peque\u00f1a Maya! Seguramente habr\u00e1 hecho ya alguna de las suyas. Es encantadora, pero muy traviesa, muy traviesa, \u00f1a, \u00f1a, \u00f1a, \u00f1a. \u00a1Bueno, bueno! \u00a1Bueno! \u00a1Uy! \u00a1Ah! Y ahora, un poquito de sopa de polio. \u00a1No, no, no! Esta te dar\u00e1 fuerzas para volar. No, puedo comer m\u00e1s bulla, reventar. \u00a1Cambiar m\u00e1s!  Vamos, a\u00fan puedes tomar otro plato de sopa. Venga, abre la boca. Ay, pero es que no puedo comer nada m\u00e1s. Empiezo a sentirme mal y muy pesado. \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa, Willy? \u00bfEs que no te encuentras bien? Ay, mi tripa est\u00e1 tan llena que reventar\u00e1. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 est\u00e1 tan llena tu tripa? Ay, Maya pensaba que no ten\u00eda bastantes cuantas para volar y tuve que comerme todo eso. Ay. Ay, ay. Ay, ay. Maya. Ay. Ay.  \u00a1Ah\u00ed viene mi peque\u00f1a amiga! \u00a1Enhorabuena por tu primer vuelo, Maya! Est\u00e1 tan preocupada que ni me oye. \u00a1Qu\u00e9 bien huele aqu\u00ed! Deben ser las flores. \u00bfNo son maravillosas? \u00a1Buenos d\u00edas, flores! \u00a1Soy Maya!  \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya! \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1s? \u00a1S\u00ed, ya voy, ya voy, se\u00f1orita Casandra! \u00a1Estar\u00e9 con usted enseguida! \u00a1Es muy duro el trabajo de recoger miel! \u00a1Ay, ay, ay! \u00a1No! \u00a1Todos en la misma flor! \u00a1No! \u00a1Ay, ay, ay! \u00a1No! \u00a1No! \u00a1No! \u00a1Ay, ay, ay! \u00a1Ay, ay, ay!  \u00a1Oh, este debe ser un capullo! \u00a1Eh, eh, eh! \u00a1Este es mi capullo! \u00a1Sal de aqu\u00ed, sal! Machacando la cabeza de la buena gente con un cacharro de miel. \u00a1Ay, ha sido sin querer! \u00a1Hola! \u00bfHay alguien ah\u00ed dentro? \u00a1Cuidado que voy con mi jarra! De verdad, recolectar miel no es un juego. Una vez no hace da\u00f1o. No deber\u00edamos probar... \u00a1Mmm, fresco!  \u00a1Est\u00e1 tan rica! Si tu jarra est\u00e1 llena, no importa probar un poco. \u00a1Sale un poquito! Esta flor huele especialmente bien. \u00a1Vamos a ver!  \u00a1Mira la jarra! Nadie me dijo que esta pesaba tanto. \u00a1Ay, Dios m\u00edo, lo que pesa! Tendr\u00e9 que descansar un poco. \u00a1Ay, mi jarra de miel! \u00a1La ramita se movi\u00f3 de repente! Soy una oruba y no una ramita. Eres un bicho horroroso. Bueno, es que...  \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 la peque\u00f1a Maya se ha cansado tan pronto? \u00bfQui\u00e9n se est\u00e1 riendo de m\u00ed? \u00bfAlguien dijo mi nombre? Soy yo. Me he tomado la libertad de re\u00edrme de mi peque\u00f1a amiga. No tengas miedo. Soy Flip, el saltamontes y tu buen amigo. Te conozco muy bien, Maya. \u00bfConocerme t\u00fa? No.  \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1s? Aqu\u00ed arriba, en la hoja. \u00bfNo podr\u00edas estarte quieto mientras me hablan? Y ahora dime, \u00bfde qu\u00e9 me conocen? Te conozco desde el d\u00eda en que saliste del panal. \u00bfQu\u00e9? \u00bfDesde que nac\u00ed? \u00a1S\u00ed! Y supongo que para ti es normal saltar como un loco cuando hablas con alguien. Bueno, es una costumbre, por eso soy un saltamontes.  Me paso la vida saltando y comiendo y me divierto observando a los dem\u00e1s Y me lo paso en grande Pues eso no est\u00e1 bien No te enfades, prometo ayudarte cuando tengas dificultades Y estoy seguro de que las tendr\u00e1s siendo como eres tan curiosa y tan impertinente \u00a1Hasta la vista! \u00a1Espera un momento!  \u00a1Qu\u00e9 b\u00e1rbaro c\u00f3mo salta! \u00a1Qu\u00e9 conflicto el m\u00edo! Deber\u00edan hacer las jarras de miel con una tapadera para que no se salga.  Bueno, bueno. Hoy hab\u00e9is aprendido a recoger la miel. \u00bfLo hab\u00e9is pasado bien? \u00a1S\u00ed! Pero no sirve de nada recoger tanta como lo hizo Maya, porque la jarra se vuelve tan pesada que es muy dif\u00edcil llevarla. No se puede aprender todo en un d\u00eda. Casandra deber\u00eda saber muy bien eso. No se gan\u00f3 Zamora en una hora. Las cosas necesitan su tiempo. Y no olvid\u00e9is que cuando vol\u00e9is hay que...  Tener mucho cuidado con la ara\u00f1a y su tela. La ara\u00f1a es nuestro peor enemigo. \u00bfA d\u00f3nde ha ido Maya otra vez? En cuanto la pierdo de vista, se va. \u00bfEst\u00e1 volando por ah\u00ed? Tiene muchos p\u00e1jaros en la cabeza. Mira c\u00f3mo se mueve todo nada m\u00e1s tocarlo. \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya, ven aqu\u00ed inmediatamente! Esta chica est\u00e1... \u00a1Estoy aqu\u00ed, se\u00f1orita! \u00a1C\u00f3jame!  Mira, Maya. \u00a1Vuelo directamente hacia la tela ara\u00f1a! \u00a1Maya, Maya, Maya! Es que hace un momento que deb\u00e9is tener cuidado con la tela de ara\u00f1a. Pero claro, como siempre, t\u00fa te hab\u00edas ido a otro sitio. \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya, qu\u00e9date aqu\u00ed! \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1s? \u00a1Aqu\u00ed estoy! \u00a1Aqu\u00ed! \u00a1D\u00e9jate hacer tonter\u00edas! \u00bfMe oyes? \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya! \u00a1No! \u00a1D\u00e9jame! \u00a1D\u00e9jame! \u00a1Maya!  \u00a1Ah! \u00a1Esta vez s\u00ed que has estado cerca! \u00bfQu\u00e9? \u00a1Ah! \u00a1Eres t\u00fa, Flip! \u00bfTe das cuenta del peligro que has corrido?  \u00a1No! \u00a1Qu\u00e9 peligro! Es que no has visto la telara\u00f1a. \u00bfY qu\u00e9 es eso, Flip? Ya no soy tu maestro. Preg\u00fantaselo a la se\u00f1orita Casandra. \u00bfQu\u00e9 es lo que debo preguntar a la se\u00f1orita Casandra? \u00a1Qu\u00e9 t\u00edo malgracias! \u00a1Vaya!  Bueno, aqu\u00ed estamos de nuevo. Despacio, no tir\u00e9is la miel. Con cuidado, vamos. Hab\u00eda recogido tanta miel y ya no me queda nada.  No voy a dejar que sonr\u00edan de m\u00ed. Llenar\u00e9 mi jarra otra vez. No tengo ganas. \u00a1Hurra!  \u00a1Uy! \u00a1Una salta mortal! \u00a1Una salta mortal! \u00a1Uy! \u00bfQu\u00e9 era eso?  \u00a1Ay, Dios m\u00edo! \u00bfQu\u00e9 me ha pasado ahora? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no puedo volar as\u00ed de repente? \u00a1Se\u00f1orita! \u00a1Se\u00f1orita! \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1? \u00a1Se\u00f1orita Casandra! \u00a1Se\u00f1orita Casandra! \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1?  \u00a1Se\u00f1orita! \u00a1Se\u00f1orita Cassandra! No puedo volar m\u00e1s, Dios m\u00edo. \u00bfQu\u00e9 voy a hacer? \u00bfY qu\u00e9 pasar\u00e1 cuando oscurezca? Peque\u00f1a Maya, \u00bfqu\u00e9 viene esa cara? \u00a1Flip, eres t\u00fa! Te has mojado las alas, \u00bfeh? S\u00fabete a mi lomo, se secar\u00e1 mientras saltamos. \u00bfY si me caigo?  \u00a1Ah! Ag\u00e1rrate fuerte, voy a emplear mis saltos m\u00e1s largos Un, dos, tres, \u00f1o, \u00f1o, \u00f1o, \u00f1o \u00a1Sigue, esto es fant\u00e1stico! \u00a1Estupendo! \u00a1Qu\u00e9 cortillo me hace!  \u00a1El viento! \u00a1Salto! \u00a1Quieres que salte m\u00e1s alto, Maya! \u00a1No, no, no! \u00a1Para, para, para! \u00bfYa est\u00e1s bien? \u00bfSe han sacado tus alas, Maya? \u00a1S\u00ed, s\u00ed! \u00a1Todo vuelve a ser como antes, Flip! \u00a1S\u00ed, s\u00ed!  a tu maestra cuando te pregunte por qu\u00e9 has estado tanto tiempo por ah\u00ed fuera. Me temo que en eso no te voy a poder ayudar, lo vas a tener que solucionar t\u00fa sola. \u00a1Hasta la vista!  La peque\u00f1a maya no se cansa de volar. Le gustar\u00eda volar alto, muy alto, hasta llegar al sol. En el pr\u00f3ximo episodio, la abeja maya... No, no, no, no os voy a contar nada. Pero os aseguro que ser\u00e1 una historia divertida y emocionante. Hasta entonces, amiguitos.  \u00a9 BF-WATCH TV 2021  \u00a9 BF-WATCH TV 2021",
        "translated": "In a multi-colored country, a bee was born under the sun, and was famous in the place, for being of its kindness. Grandma's bee, Grandma's bee, This beautiful sweet bee Maya Goes good without ceasing In her world without evil There is no problem that Maya can't solve The mischievous and sweet bee Maya Maya I love you Maya Maya Maya, Maya, Maya, come and tell us about yourself. Stop! The password! Come! A little grove of birch, hazel, saffron rose. Go ahead. A few sips of plant juice. In the morning it's a delicious treat. Good morning, ladies. Working so early? No, the airways are very... busy this morning I see. Oh, right! A queen bee. That's why there's so much fuss. The bees are having a party. Oh! Come on! Come on! Come on! Quick! Quick! The honeycombs are melting! Come on! Everybody to the honeycombs! The honey is coming out! Come on! Come on! Come on! Quick! What's the matter? Why are they shouting so much? Hey, Willy! Wait! What are you doing here, Willy? Just like the others, flapping my wings. What nonsense! What for? Gosh, I'll pretend I didn't hear that. I had despaired. There were too many bees in the hive, too much heat, and they had to swarm. Now what we have to do is create a draft. When it's too hot, the wax melts in the honeycombs and the eggs and larvae die, understand? Hey, Maya! Where are you going? Stay here, we're not going to learn to fly yet. I know that, but when I move my wings I can't help it. I'm sorry. Good! Good! Aha! Aha! Well, they've done it again. I think they're a bit nuts. Well, it's all the same to me. In my little hole in the ground it's nice and warm, but they have to build a hive with thousands and thousands of rooms. Oh no! Silence on the back bench! Silence on the back bench! always lurking in the dark. That's why a bee must never leave the hive at night, don't forget that. Miss, may I ask a question? Yes, what is it, Maya? When can we finally get out of here and fly away? The promised one has been here for over a week now. Exactly. An old proverb says, experience is the mother of science. Don't be so impertinent. When the time comes, you'll fly away. And when will that time come, eh? And besides, what do you mean by when the time comes? I mean, it will be this very evening. Maya! Maya! Maya's gonna fly, Maya's gonna fly. Now Maya's gonna fly. Now Maya's gonna fly, she's gonna fly. Maya! I'm sorry. Can't you watch where you're going? I'm just so nervous. Why am I going to be allowed to fly for the first time? It's so great. And you know what? I'm gonna fly straight into the sun. Maya's gonna fly! Maya! I remember my first flight very well. My God, it's been so long now. We don't want to fool you. Now we're going to fly, fly, fly. Stop, stop! It's me. Tell me, are you Willy, eh? No, I'm Maya. Oh, I thought you were Willy. Go on, go on, go on. What's the matter with Willy? Nothing, nothing, just go on, little one. Okay, okay. Ah! Ah! Well, you're here? I thought you were looking forward to flying. And I am. But first I had to tell everyone that I'm going to fly for the first time today. I've brushed my wings! Look, look how shiny they are! Come on, kids, let's get started. Great! Maybe it's a little low, don't you think? Come on, Maya, you try it. All right. Help, help, help! Oops, I'm falling! That always happens when you try to fly too high. How strange! Someone's missing here. Isn't Willy here? No? How funny! Why didn't he come to class with us? Do you know why he is not here, Miss? He may be sick. Ah. Maya! Maya! Go with the others and they will not leave. Flying. They're gone now, Willy. What? Then why did you come back? Why? Because I didn't feel like flying. That's not true. Don't fool me. You were crazy about flying. Much more than us. It's my fault, Pia. Because of me you stayed behind. Because I can't fly because of that. It's not true. Didn't you stay here for me? And what does it matter why I stayed? Don't you want me to read you a story? You knew that, didn't you? Did you know that I was afraid to fly? Because I don't know how to, and that's why you've come back. What idea have you got into your head? It's not that I imagine that I don't know how to fly, it's that I don't know. The old bee proverb is right. A friend is the most precious treasure. It seems that the little bees are making their first outing today. I don't see Maya with them. Maybe they've locked her up again. What? I'm curious to know. I'll ask Miss Cassandra. This will make him look twice, ma'am. We grasshoppers are clever fellows. How rude! Doing somersaults when you're in the mood! Talking to a lady. Oh, you don't understand me, my dear lady! I have hot blood and a lot of temper, a lot of temper, \u00f1a, \u00f1a, \u00f1a, \u00f1a. Oh, our little Maya! She's probably done some of her thing already. She's charming, but very naughty, very naughty, \u00f1a, \u00f1a, \u00f1a, \u00f1a. Well, well! Well! Oops! Ah! And now, a little chicken soup. No, no, no! This will give you strength to fly. No, I can eat more noise, burst. Change more! Come on, you can still have another bowl of soup. Come on, open your mouth. Oh, but I can't eat anything else. I'm beginning to feel sick and very heavy. What's the matter, Willy? Are you not feeling well? Ouch, my belly is so full it's going to burst. Why is your belly so full? Ouch, Maya thought I didn't have enough balls to fly and I had to eat all that. Ouch. Ouch, ouch. Ouch, ouch. Maya. Ouch. Ouch. There comes my little friend! Congratulations on your first flight, Maya! She's so worried she can't even hear me. It smells so good in here! It must be the flowers. Aren't they wonderful? Good morning, flowers! I'm Maya! Maya! Maya! Where are you? Yes, I'm coming, I'm coming, Miss Cassandra! I'll be with you in a moment! It's very hard work collecting honey! Ouch, ouch, ouch! No! All in the same flower! No! Ouch, ouch, ouch! No! No! No! Ouch, ouch, ouch! Ouch, ouch, ouch! Oh, this must be a cocoon! Hey, hey, hey! This is my cocoon! Get out of here, get out! Crushing good people's heads with a honey pot. Oops, that was by accident! Hello! Is anyone in there? Watch out, I'm coming with my jar! Seriously, collecting honey is no game. Once never hurts. We shouldn't try... Mmm, fresh! It's so delicious! If your jar is full, it's okay to try a little. Just a little comes out! This flower smells especially good. Let's see! Look at the jar! Nobody told me it was so heavy. Oh, my God, it's so heavy! I'll have to rest for a while. Oh, my honey jar! The twig suddenly moved! I'm a honeybee and not a twig. You're a horrible bug. Well, it's just that... Why did little Maya get tired so soon? Who is laughing at me? Did someone say my name? It's me. I've taken the liberty of laughing at my little friend. Don't be afraid. I'm Flip, the grasshopper and your good friend. I know you very well, Maya. Do you know me? No. Where are you? Up here on the leaf. Couldn't you just keep still while they talk to me? Now tell me, how do they know me? I've known you since the day you came out of the hive. What? Since I was born? Yes! And I suppose it's normal for you to jump like crazy when you talk to someone. Well, it's a habit, that's why I'm a grasshopper. I spend my life jumping and eating and I have fun watching other people And I have a great time Well that's not right Don't be angry, I promise to help you when you have difficulties And I'm sure you will have them being as curious and impertinent as you are See you later! Wait a minute! How amazing it jumps! What a problem I have! They should make honey jars with a lid so it doesn't spill out. Well, well. Today you have learned to collect honey. Did you have a good time? Yes! But there is no point in collecting as much as Maya did, because the jar becomes so heavy that it is very difficult to carry it. You cannot learn everything in one day. Cassandra should know that very well. Zamora was not won in an hour. Things take time. And do not forget that when you fly you have to... Be very careful with the spider and its web. The spider is our worst enemy. Where has Maya gone again? As soon as I lose sight of her, she's gone. Is she flying around? She has a lot of birds on her head. Look how everything moves as soon as you touch it. Maya! Maya, come here immediately! This girl is... I'm here, lady! Catch me! Look, Maya! I'm flying straight towards the spider web! Maya, Maya, Maya! It's just that a moment ago you had to be careful of the spider web. But of course, as usual, you had gone somewhere else. Maya! Maya, stay here! Where are you? I'm here! Here! Stop doing this nonsense! Do you hear me? Maya! Maya! No! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Maya! Ah! That was close this time! What? Ah! It's you, Flip! Do you realize how much danger you've been in? No! How dangerous! You just haven't seen the spider web. What's that, Flip? I'm not your teacher anymore. Ask Miss Cassandra. What should I ask Miss Cassandra? What a mean guy! Wow! Well, here we are again. Slowly, don't spill the honey. Carefully, come on. I've collected so much honey and now I have none left. I won't let them smile at me. I'll fill my mug again. I don't feel like it. Hurray! Oops! A somersault! A somersault! Oops! What was that? Oh my God! What happened to me now? Why can't I fly away all of a sudden? Miss! Miss! Where are you? Miss Cassandra! Miss Cassandra! Where are you? Miss! Miss Cassandra! I can't fly anymore, my God. What am I going to do? And what will happen when it gets dark? Little Maya, what's that face? Flip, it's you! You've got your wings wet, eh? Get on my back, they'll dry off while we jump. What if I fall? Ah! Hold on tight, I'm gonna use my longest jumps. One, two, three, noo, noo, noo, noo. Keep going, this is fantastic! Great! It makes me look so short! The wind! Jump! You want me to jump higher, Maya! No, no, no! Stop, stop, stop! Are you okay now? Are your wings gone, Maya? Yeah, yeah! Everything's back to the way it was, Flip! Yeah, yeah! to your teacher when she asks you why you've been out there for so long. I'm afraid I can't help you with that, you'll have to figure it out on your own. See you later! Little Maya never tires of flying. She would like to fly high, very high, until she reaches the sun. In the next episode, Maya the bee... No, no, no, I'm not going to tell you anything. But I assure you that it will be a fun and exciting story. Until then, my friends. \u00a9 BF-WATCH TV 2021 \u00a9 BF-WATCH TV 2021"

        "original": " Wann immer sich ein Abenteuer lohnt, Angst und Schrecken kennen wir nicht, denn das sind wir gewohnt. Wo immer ein R\u00e4tsel zu l\u00f6sen ist, hoch in dem alten Schloss oder im Schwung, ja, Mest, f\u00fcnf Freunde, das sind wir. Julian, Dick und M, George und Tim, wie der Hund.  Und f\u00fcnf Freunde, das sind wir. Wir kommen schnell herbei, wann immer wir es wollen. Und schon sind wir da.  Na, wie weit sind Sie, Mr. Rogers? Gleich fertig, Mrs. Kirill. Gut. George! George! George! George, mach dich doch bitte schon mal fertig. Und vielleicht r\u00e4umst du auch dein Zimmer auf, Sie m\u00fcssen jeden Tag...  Ich will jeden Moment hier sein. Wie weit ist es noch, Julia? Vielleicht noch eine Meile. Vom Bahnhof aus sind wir ungef\u00e4hr f\u00fcnf Meilen gefahren. Ist ja nicht zu glauben. Endlich geht es mal bergab. Ist ja irre sch\u00f6n hier, was? Ja, ja, eine tolle Luft. Oh, guck doch mal das Meer. Das da dr\u00fcben ist bestimmt Cairn Island. Ja, m\u00fcsste es eigentlich. Was ist denn das f\u00fcr ein komischer Turm? Keine Ahnung.  Aber Ginny wei\u00df das bestimmt. Los, wir wollen wenigstens p\u00fcnktlich sein. George! Georgina! Also wirklich Georgina. Georgina! Komm her!  Das muss es sein. Los! Los! Entschuldigen Sie bitte. Ist das die Karen Cottage? Wieso willst du das wissen? Wir sind Verwandte von Georgina. Wie?  Ihre Mutter hat uns eingeladen. So eine lause Bande hat Professor Kirin noch gefehlt. Und drei mehr, die herumwimmeln, L\u00e4rm machen und ihn bei der Arbeit st\u00f6ren. Er hat verdammtes Gl\u00fcck, dass er meistens auf der Insel ist. Dann hat er wohl diesen komischen Turm gebaut. Ja, hat was mit seinem Experiment zu tun. Ist aber streng geheim, klar? Also seht euch vor und plaudert nicht mit fremden Leuten dar\u00fcber. Und lasst euch ja nicht in einem meiner Gem\u00fcsebeete erwischen.  Ach, da seid ihr ja. Ist aber sch\u00f6n, euch mal wiederzusehen. Tag, Tante Fanny. Ihr seid vielleicht gewachsen, seit ich euch das letzte Mal gesehen habe. Anne war damals noch ein Baby. Wartet mal, du m\u00fcsstest Julian sein und das ist Dick. Na, wie war die Reise? Einfach klasse, Tante Fanny. Die Fahrt vom Bahnhof hierher war doch prima. Ja, na gut. Ich habe beim Bahnhof angerufen, euer Gep\u00e4ck wird hergebracht. Stellt die Fahrr\u00e4der hinters Haus, gleich gibt's Tee. Ihr habt doch bestimmt auch Hunger.  Und Sie, stell dir vor, die beiden w\u00e4ren beinahe vom Rad gefallen. Besonders Andy war so schwach, dass er sich immer den Kopf gehalten hat. Der fehlt irgendwie Vitamine. Immer muss diese bl\u00f6de Witze machen. Ja, ja, eure Mutter hat mir schon gesagt, dass ihr solche Scherze treibt. Dann l\u00e4sst man jetzt gar nicht hin, dann wird das ein Selbstmord. Wunderbarer Nachmittag, Herr Johnson. Wunderbarer Nachmittag. Ja, muss ich auch sagen, Mr. Johnson. Ich hoffe, Sie haben gut gespeist. Passabel. Es wurde nur ein bisschen zu viel geredet.  Es wird Zeit f\u00fcr eine sch\u00f6ne Tasse B\u00fcrotee. Oh ja. Ja. \u00c4h, Miss Peters, ich muss unvorhergesehenerweise f\u00fcr ein paar Tage wegfahren.  Ich bin sicher, der Minister wird bis zu meiner R\u00fcckkehr auch ohne mich auskommen. Lassen Sie bitte den Wagen vorfahren, Miss Peters. Ja, Mr. Johnson. Dankesch\u00f6n. Ich habe mir gedacht, morgen fahren wir alle auf die Insel und essen zu Mittag mit Onkel Quentin. Klasse! Wo ist denn Georgina, Tante Fanny? Wir haben uns schon so auf sie gefreut. Wei\u00df auch nicht, wo sie ist.  sie ist. Also George verschwindet immer gerade dann, wenn sie es nicht soll. Aber wieso nennst du sie George? Sie will es so. Aber jeder denkt dann, sie ist ein Junge und kein M\u00e4dchen. Anscheinend will sie es nicht anders. Also ich m\u00f6chte nicht, dass man denkt, ich w\u00e4re ein Junge. Nein, nat\u00fcrlich nicht. Aber du bist ja auch nicht wie George. Ach, dass du dich auch mal sehen l\u00e4sst. Wir haben fast alles aufgegessen. Ich habe keinen Hunger. Danke, Mutter. Willst du nicht guten Tag sagen? Das sind Annie, Dick und Julian. Hallo. Tag.  Hallo. Hallo. Warum gehst du nicht mit ihm raus, George, und zeigst ihm ein bisschen die Gegend? Aber ich muss doch noch... Ja, was? Was musst du? Nichts. Dann ist's ja gut. Also ab mit euch. Ich r\u00e4um den Tisch ab. Danke f\u00fcr den Tee, Tante Fanny. Der Honig war auch ganz gut. Viel Spa\u00df, Kinder. H\u00f6rt mal. Kommt nicht zu sp\u00e4t zur\u00fcck. Nein, nein.  Tante Fanny hat gesagt, wir wurden morgen auf Onkel Quentys Insel fahren. Findest du das nicht klasse, Georgina? Mein Name ist nicht Georgina, ich hei\u00dfe George. Und die Insel geh\u00f6rt nicht ihm, sondern mir. Was regst du dich denn gleich auf? Sie geh\u00f6rt mir. Er hat sie mir geschenkt. Und jetzt arbeitet er da und l\u00e4sst mich \u00fcberhaupt nicht mehr hin. Aber wenn seine Arbeit ein so gro\u00dfes Geheimnis ist, warum macht er sie dann an einem Ort, wo jeder hinkommen kann, wenn er will? Du kannst es ja mal versuchen.  und die Klippen vor der Insel machen aus deinem Boot Kleinholz. Nur Vater und ich wissen, wie man da durchkommt. Er ist dort, weil er dicke Zeiten f\u00fcr seine Experimente braucht. Deshalb ist er auf meiner Insel. Also das f\u00e4nde ich auch prima, in einer eigenen Insel zu arbeiten. H\u00f6rt mal, ich habe jetzt was zu erledigen. Das geht nur mich was an, verstanden? Also kommt mir blo\u00df nicht hinterhergeschlichen, keiner von euch. Wir haben was Besseres zu tun. Das kann ja lustig werden mit dir. Na, f\u00fcr euch ist es ja nicht weiter schlimm, aber ich muss mit dir in einem Zimmer schlafen. Ich sage euch, das werden bestimmt zwei verdammt lange Wochen dauern.  Kochen wir uns. Darf ich Ihnen noch eins bringen? Warum nicht, wenn Sie es bezahlen, gerne. Oh, das w\u00e4re mir ein Vergn\u00fcgen. Bitte? Danke. Timmy! Timmy! Oh, komm Timmy, komm! Na los, komm!  Na komm, mein Kleiner. Och, Timmy. Das ist die Kleine von Quentin Curran, nicht wahr? Ja. Die ist wilder als ein Junge. Und die meisten hier sagen nur George zu ihr. Zum Wohl. Zum Wohl. Und das da ist ihr Hund. Der Professor.  wollte den Hund nicht im Haus haben. Sie sollte ihn weggeben, aber an dem K\u00f6ter h\u00e4ngt sie mehr als an allem anderen. Sagen Sie, wo ist Quentin jetzt? Ich habe ihn lange nicht mehr gesehen. Er hat sich fast v\u00f6llig auf die Insel zur\u00fcckgezogen, experimentiert. Er kommt \u00fcberhaupt nicht mehr r\u00fcber. Seine Frau bringt alles, was er braucht, zur Insel r\u00fcber. Vorher muss sie aber immer erst signalisieren, dass alles in Ordnung ist. Dann blinkt er dreimal vom Turm mit einer Taschenlampe. Jeden Morgen und jeden Abend um elf, danach k\u00f6nnen sie ihre Uhr stellen. Jeder hat seine Marotten. Ist das nicht verr\u00fcckt, so viel zu arbeiten?  Los, komm, hier gef\u00e4llt's mir. Wenn sich Georgina nur nicht so furchtbar bl\u00f6d benehmen w\u00fcrde. Sag blo\u00df George zu ihr. Wer zuletzt oben ist, muss morgen das Eis bezahlen. Das sagst du nur, weil ich sowieso verliere.  Sieht hier aber sehr einsam aus. Hey, seht mal. Sieht aus, als w\u00e4re das eine gro\u00dfe H\u00f6hle. Kommt mal her. Da kann man nicht viel sehen. Kommt, wir gehen mal tiefer rein. Wir k\u00f6nnen doch nicht ohne Taschenlampe reingehen. Gut, dann gehen wir eben zur\u00fcck und holen uns eine. Daf\u00fcr reicht die Zeit nicht. Wisst ihr was, wir kommen morgen nochmal her und untersuchen sie.  dann? Klar, die l\u00e4uft uns ja nicht weg. Wartet mal. Wir behalten das aber f\u00fcr uns, ja? George hat ihr Geheimnis und diese H\u00f6hle ist nun unser Geheimnis, okay? Okay. Oh, hallo Kinder. Ihr seid doch zu Besuch auf Kirin Cottage, nicht wahr? Ja, das stimmt. Ist George nicht mitgekommen? Nein.  Euer Onkel und eure Tante sind gute Freunde von mir. Wollt ihr morgen nicht bei mir Tee trinken? Naja, ich wei\u00df noch nicht, was wir morgen... Naja, ist ja egal. Kommt, wenn ihr Lust habt. Ich w\u00fcrde mich freuen. Auf Wiedersehen. Komischer Kauz. Das Wimmelchen nur so von merkw\u00fcrdigen Leuten. Tante Fanny ist der einzig normale Mensch, der mir hier bisher begegnet ist. Onkel Quentin scheint ja wohl auch ein bisschen komisch zu sein.  Wenn wir morgen feststellen, wenn wir r\u00fcberfahren auf die Insel, nicht wahr? Darf ich rudern, George? Nein, die Klippen sind zu gef\u00e4hrlich, aber ablegen darfst du.  Da sitzen Kinder. Vater! Vater! Ist er immer in seinem Turm, Tante Penny? Nein, wenn wir ihn rufen, kommt er meistens sofort.  George, nimm die Jungs mit und seht, ob ihr ihn findet. Okay, komm. Ich freu mich schon aufs Essen. Vater! Vater! Mann, sowas hab ich ja noch nie gesehen. Seht euch das an! Sag mal, George, wei\u00dft du, was das f\u00fcr Dinger sind da oben am Turm? Ich k\u00f6nnte mir vorstellen, dass das irgendwas mit Sonnenenergie zu tun hat. Die Reflektoren oder wie das hei\u00dft, stehen vielleicht woanders.  Vater! Vater! Er ist wohl nicht da oben. Irgendwo muss er doch sein. Hier bin ich!  Professor Curran. Ihre Insel scheint ja ziemliche Aufmerksamkeit zu erringen.  Du bist gewachsen seit dem letzten Mal. Das war vor acht Jahren, Onkel Quentin. Ach wirklich? Dann war es ja wohl zu erwarten, oder was meint ihr? Wo treibst du dich denn im Moment auf der Insel rum? In den Kellern. In den Kellern? Unter den Ruinen, die Keller vom alten Schloss. Sag mal, ist das dein Geheimlabor? Ja, ja, wenn man will, kann man es.  zu nennen k\u00fcmmert sich georgia anst\u00e4ndig um euch sie hat uns raus gerudert um die gef\u00e4hrlichen klippen rum alle achtung die kann rudern besser als ein junge wei\u00df so jetzt muss ich erst mal zur\u00fcck ich habe da noch was zu kontrollieren danke f\u00fcr den nachschub george du kannst deine insel bald zur\u00fcck haben ich bin so gut wie fertig und vergisst die signale nicht ich mache mir sonst noch nicht denkt dran  Am\u00fcsiert euch noch gut. Also dann, Wiedersehen. Wiedersehen. Sieh da, sieh da. Eine reizende \u00dcberraschung, Sie wiederzusehen, Curtin. Johnson. Ich nehme an, Sie beobachten seltene Wasserv\u00f6gel, nicht wahr? Was f\u00fcr ein hervorragendes Teleskop. Ja, das ist der...  ein ausgezeichnetes Fernrohr. Ach, sagen Sie mir, f\u00fcr wen arbeiten Sie denn diesmal? Russland, China, Amerika? Damals, als wir uns das letzte Mal begegneten, waren Sie f\u00fcr uns sehr unbequem, K\u00f6rten. Ich hoffe, dass Sie sich dar\u00fcber klar sind. H\u00f6ren Sie, ich arbeite f\u00fcr niemanden. Ich gebe Ihnen mein Wort. Ihr Wort. Ach, wenn das kein Funkger\u00e4t ist, will ich sofort tot umfallen. So, das reicht. Bitte.  Schickt eure Schwimmwesten rein, ja? So, und du tr\u00e4gst das. So, komm Kinder. George, was machst du denn heute Nachmittag? Das ist ja wohl meine Sache. Ich habe nur gedacht, weil wir etwas Interessantes gefunden haben. Was denn? Das ist unser Geheimnis. Wir sind hinter dem H\u00fcgel am Ende vom Strand. Du kannst es dir ja nochmal \u00fcberlegen. Es ist wirklich eine tolle Sache, was wir da gefunden haben. George, komm!  Ich verstehe Sie nicht, Curtin, dass Sie mit denen wieder Gesch\u00e4fte machen. Hallo? Karner? Herr Johnson, wie sch\u00f6n, mal wieder Ihre Stimme zu h\u00f6ren. Ich habe das Gef\u00fchl, Ihre T\u00e4tigkeit ist in ein unangenehmes Stadium getreten, mein Verehrter. Pech f\u00fcr Sie. Ach, \u00fcbrigens noch was. Sie werden Mr. Curtin auf der Frequenz nicht mehr empfangen. Johnson, h\u00f6ren Sie!  Wir sind sich wohl dar\u00fcber klark\u00f6rten, dass sie Unannehmlichkeiten bekommen. Zuerst einmal werden wir beide uns gr\u00fcndlich unterhalten. Ich glaube, hier ist schon ewig keiner mehr gewesen. Man kann nicht mal das Ende sehen. Hier muss unheimlich weit rein gehen. Kommt! Das ist keine H\u00f6hle. Das ist ein Tunnel, den irgendjemand gebaut hat. Der ist ja unheimlich lang.  Er geht sicher weiter bis unten ans Meer. Was ist denn das? Das ist ein Hund. Hey, wer bist du denn? Wem der wo geh\u00f6rt? Keine Ahnung, vielleicht irgendjemanden am Strand. Timmy! Timmy, wo bist du? Das ist doch George. Ich h\u00f6re wohl nicht richtig. Das ist also ihr tolles Geheimnis. Kommt! Timmy, wie oft habe ich dir schon gesagt, dass du keine Kaninchen jagen sollst? F\u00fchlt sich nicht gef\u00e4hrlich an, wenn ich dir was sage.  Mach denn ein artiger Hund sowas? Du bist ein ganz schlimmer. Komm jetzt, muss man dir denn alles tausendmal sagen? Hallo, George. Dick. Das ist also Timmy. Woher wei\u00dft du denn seinen Namen? Du hast ihn doch gerade gerufen. Der hat uns einen gro\u00dfen Schreck eingejagt. Der ist ja wirklich s\u00fc\u00df, George. Geh\u00f6rt er dir? Ja. Und warum haben wir ihn noch nicht im Haus gesehen? Vater hat mir verboten, ihn zu behalten, aber ein Junge im Dorf versorgt ihn f\u00fcr mich. Ich w\u00fcrde lieber verhungern, als dass ich ihn weggeben w\u00fcrde. Und au\u00dferdem halte ich es um.  ihn auch nicht aus. Ach, jetzt kapiere ich das. Deshalb haust du also so viel ab. Aber du brauchst keine Angst zu haben. Wir verraten dein Geheimnis nicht. Ganz bestimmt nicht, George. Verspricht er mir das? Ja, wir versprechen es. Uns gef\u00e4llt dir doch genauso gut wie dir. Ja. Freunde? Freunde. Ich fand das sowieso nicht gut, dass wir Feinde waren. Was ich dir noch sagen wollte, George, der Tunnel, den wir gefunden haben, das ist kein normaler Tunnel. Sehr weit sind wir nicht gekommen, aber wir haben ein paar Stufen gefunden. Ja, die f\u00fchren direkt in die Erde. Und in Richtung Tumir.  raus kommst du mit na klar kommt hallo kinder aber es ist nun mit meiner einladung gehen wir lieber bevor er uns fragt was sie hier unten suchen ja ich habe sowieso hunger okay wir kommen macht euch bequem dann setzt euch schuldig das ist ein bisschen unaufger\u00e4umt ist  Seht euch mal das Fernrohr an. Oh ja, das ist mein Hobby. Ich beobachte V\u00f6gel. Karen Island. Oh, ich kann ja Onkel Quentins Turm ganz deutlich sehen. Eine Art Raben. Pyrokorax. Seltene K\u00fcstenv\u00f6gel. Ein paar davon habe ich auf der Insel ersp\u00e4ht. Tja, und euch habe ich nat\u00fcrlich auch gesehen. Na, wie geht es denn deinem Vater? Meinem Vater? Ach ja. Er ist fast fertig, hat er gesagt. Ach, ist er das? Ja. Der gute alte Quentin. \u00c4h, nun ja. Vielleicht k\u00f6nntet ihr mir helfen, den Tisch zu decken. Ein bisschen Kuchen und Kekse.  sind dort drin ich mache inzwischen den t nicht da oben du findest alles in dem unteren fach mein junge entschuldigung ach du meine g\u00fcte die tante ich meine meine tante tante john sie kommt zum tee habt ihr das vergessen sie kennen sie doch sicher so ja nat\u00fcrlich ja die tage ist wirklich reizend leider gleich weg tut mir leid auf wiedersehen und vielen dank  Tja, aber... Es war wirklich bl\u00f6d von uns. Entschuldigen Sie bitte. Trotzdem vielen Dank. Auf Wiedersehen. Na ja, dann vielleicht ein andermal. Wer ist denn Tante Joan? Wir haben \u00fcberhaupt keine Tante Joan. Nat\u00fcrlich nicht, aber trotzdem hat er gesagt, er kennt sie. Der tut nur so, als w\u00e4re er ein Freund von Vater. Aber ich habe den Kerl noch niemals vorher gesehen. Du h\u00e4ttest ihm nicht sagen d\u00fcrfen, dass Vater fast fertig ist. Du wei\u00dft genau, dass das geheim ist. Tut mir leid, George. Ich habe nicht daran gedacht. Meinst du nicht, du \u00fcbertreibst die Sache ein bisschen, George? Nein, nicht nicht.  Ich glaube, sie hat recht. Du hast bestimmt nicht gesehen, was in dem Schrank war. Da war ein Funkger\u00e4t, ein ziemlich gro\u00dfes. Oh Mann! Wirklich ausgezeichnet, Kirk. Nun ja, es tut mir leid. Sie waren so pl\u00f6tzlich weg. Ich konnte \u00fcberhaupt keine Fragen stellen. Ich habe alles geh\u00f6rt, was ich wissen wollte. Professor Kirin ist also, wie der Junge sagte, fast fertig. Nicht so verbissen, Kirk. Sie haben noch eine Menge vor heute Nacht.  Ja, vielleicht. Trotzdem glaube ich, dass wir uns viel zu viel Gedanken machen. Solange Onkel Quentin noch p\u00fcnktlich signalisiert. Es ist gleich halb elf. Ui, das Flugzeug fliegt aber tief. Das fliegt ja \u00fcber die Insel. Habt ihr sein Zeichen schon gesehen, Kinder? Nein, noch nicht. Muss jeden Moment kommen. Mach schon, Vater, los.  Los! Da! Eins, zwei, drei. Alles in Ordnung, George. Nichts passiert. Es ist alles in Ordnung, Tante Fanny. Gut. Jetzt ab ins Bett mit euch. Marsch, marsch. Puh, da bin ich aber erleichtert. Aber morgen fr\u00fch werde ich als erstes den Turm mit einem Fernglas beobachten. Gute Nacht. Gute Nacht. Nacht. Nacht.  Professor Kirin, nehme ich an. Wer zum Teufel sind Sie? Ich glaube kaum, dass Sie mich kennen. Mein Name ist Johnson. Ich bin vom Forschungsministerium. Gott sei Dank, Mr. Johnson. Im ersten Moment habe ich geglaubt, Sie w\u00e4ren so etwas wie ein... Ich war beim Forschungsministerium. Denn k\u00fcrzlich...  habe ich beschlossen, ein eigenes Ministerium aufzumachen. Verstehen Sie? Und dies ist der Anfang, Professor. Der beste, den ich mir denken kann. Hier auf Kirin Island.  keine Gefahr entgegen. Vertraut auf uns, wir packen's an, wer kann uns widerstehen? F\u00fcnf Freunde, das sind wir. Julian, Dick und Ed, George und Tim, wie der Hund. F\u00fcnf Freunde, das sind wir. Wir kommen schnell herbei, wann immer ihr das wollt.  Wir kommen schnell herbei Und schon sind wir da Sind wir da",
        "translated": "Whenever an adventure is worthwhile, we know no fear or terror, because we are used to it. Wherever there is a puzzle to solve, high up in the old castle or in the swing, yes, Mest, five friends, that's us. Julian, Dick and M, George and Tim, like the dog. And we are five friends. We come quickly whenever we want. And then we're there. Well, how are you, Mr. Rogers? Almost ready, Mrs. Kirill. Good. George! George! George! George, please get ready. And maybe you could tidy your room too, you have to... I want to be here any minute. How far is it, Julia? Maybe another mile. We drove about five miles from the station. It's unbelievable. Finally, we're going downhill. It's so beautiful here, isn't it? Yes, yes, great air. Oh, just look at the sea. That over there must be Cairn Island. Yes, it should be. What kind of strange tower is that? I have no idea. But Ginny probably knows that. Come on, let's at least be on time. George! Georgina! Really, Georgina. Georgina! Come here! That must be it. Come on! Come on! Excuse me. Is this Karen Cottage? Why do you want to know? We're relatives of Georgina. What? Her mother invited us. Professor Kirin was missing a lousy bunch like that. And three more who swarm around, make noise and disturb him at work. He's damn lucky that he's on the island most of the time. Then he must have built this strange tower. Yes, it has something to do with his experiment. But it's top secret, right? So be careful and don't chat about it with strangers. And don't get caught in one of my vegetable patches. Oh, there you are. It's nice to see you again. Hello, Aunt Fanny. You've grown a lot since I last saw you. Anne was just a baby then. Wait a minute, you must be Julian and this is Dick. So, how was the trip? Simply brilliant, Aunt Fanny. The journey from the station here was great. Yes, fine. I've called the station, your luggage is being brought here. Put the bikes behind the house, there'll be tea soon. I'm sure you're hungry too. And you, just imagine, the two of them nearly fell off their bikes. Andy in particular was so weak that he kept holding his head. He's somehow lacking vitamins. She always has to make stupid jokes. Yes, yes, your mother told me that you joke like that. Then you won't let it go, it will be suicide. Wonderful afternoon, Mr Johnson. Wonderful afternoon. Yes, I must say, Mr Johnson. I hope you ate well. Passable. There was just a bit too much talking. Time for a nice cup of office tea. Oh yes. Yes. Er, Miss Peters, I have to go away for a few days unexpectedly. I'm sure the Minister will manage without me until I return. Please have the car brought forward, Miss Peters. Yes, Mr Johnson. Thank you. I thought we'd all go to the island tomorrow and have lunch with Uncle Quentin. Great! Where's Georgina, Aunt Fanny? We've been looking forward to seeing her. I don't know where she is either. she is. Well, George always disappears when she shouldn't. But why do you call her George? She wants it that way. But then everyone thinks she's a boy and not a girl. Apparently she doesn't want it any other way. Well, I don't want people to think I'm a boy. No, of course not. But you're not like George either. Oh, I hope you show yourself sometimes. We've eaten almost everything. I'm not hungry. Thank you, Mother. Don't you want to say hello? This is Annie, Dick and Julian. Hello. Day. Hello. Hello. Why don't you go out with him, George, and show him around? But I've got to... Well, what? What do you have to do? Nothing. That's all right then. Off you go. I'll clear the table. Thanks for the tea, Aunt Fanny. The honey was quite good too. Have fun, children. Listen. Don't be late back. No, no. Aunt Fanny said we were going to Uncle Quenty's island tomorrow. Don't you think that's great, Georgina? My name isn't Georgina, it's George. And the island isn't his, it's mine. Why are you so upset? It's mine. He gave it to me. And now he works there and won't let me go at all. But if his work is such a big secret, why does he do it in a place where anyone can go if they want to? You can try it. and the cliffs off the island will turn your boat into splinters. Only Father and I know how to get through there. He's there because he needs a lot of time for his experiments. That's why he's on my island. I think it would be great, too, to work on my own island. Listen, I've got something to do now. That's only my business, got it? So don't sneak up on me, none of you. We've got better things to do. This could be fun with you. Well, it's not so bad for you, but I have to sleep in the same room as you. I'm telling you, it's going to take a long two weeks. Let's cook ourselves a meal. Can I get you another one? Why not, if you pay for it, I'd be happy to. Oh, that would be my pleasure. Please? Thank you. Timmy! Timmy! Oh, come on, Timmy, come on! Come on, come on! Come on, little one. Oh, Timmy. That's Quentin Curran's little one, isn't it? Yes. She's wilder than a boy. And most people here just call her George. Cheers. Cheers. And that's her dog. The professor. didn't want the dog in the house. She should give him away, but she's more attached to the mutt than anything else. Tell me, where is Quentin now? I haven't seen him for a long time. He's withdrawn almost completely to the island, experimenting. He doesn't come over at all anymore. His wife brings everything he needs over to the island. But first she always has to signal that everything is OK. Then he flashes a flashlight three times from the tower. Every morning and every evening at eleven, they can set their clocks by that. Everyone has their quirks. Isn't it crazy to work so much? Come on, I like it here. If only Georgina wouldn't behave so terribly stupidly. Just call her George. Whoever is last upstairs has to pay for the ice cream tomorrow. You're only saying that because I'm losing anyway. It looks very lonely here. Hey, look. It looks like a big cave. Come here. You can't see much. Come on, let's go deeper. We can't go in without a flashlight. OK, let's go back and get one. We don't have time for that. You know what, we'll come back tomorrow and examine it. then? Sure, she's not going to run away from us. Wait a minute. But we'll keep it to ourselves, OK? George has her secret and this cave is now our secret, OK? OK. Oh, hello kids. You're visiting Kirin Cottage, aren't you? Yes, that's right. Didn't George come with us? No. Your uncle and aunt are good friends of mine. Would you like to have tea with me tomorrow? Well, I don't know what we're going to do tomorrow... Well, it doesn't matter. Come if you feel like it. I'd be happy. Goodbye. Strange guy. The place is full of strange people. Aunt Fanny is the only normal person I've met here so far. Uncle Quentin seems to be a bit strange too. If we discover it tomorrow when we go over to the island, right? Can I row, George? No, the cliffs are too dangerous, but you can cast off. There are children sitting there. Father! Father! Is he always in his tower, Aunt Penny? No, when we call him he usually comes right away. George, take the boys and see if you can find him. OK, come on. I'm looking forward to dinner. Father! Father! Man, I've never seen anything like it. Look at that! Tell me, George, do you know what those things are up there on the tower? I imagine it has something to do with solar energy. The reflectors or whatever they're called might be somewhere else. Father! Father! He's probably not up there. He has to be somewhere. I'm here! Professor Curran. Your island seems to be attracting quite a bit of attention. You've grown since the last time. That was eight years ago, Uncle Quentin. Oh really? Then it was to be expected, don't you think? Where are you hanging out on the island at the moment? In the cellars. In the cellars? Under the ruins, the cellars of the old castle. Tell me, is that your secret laboratory? Yes, yes, if you want, you can. to name Georgia takes good care of you she rowed us out around the dangerous cliffs well done she can row better than a boy knows so now I have to go back I still have something to check thanks for the supplies George you can have your island back soon I'm as good as finished and don't forget the signals I'm not going to worry otherwise remember Have a good time. Well, bye then. Bye. Look, look. A delightful surprise to see you again, Curtin. Johnson. I suppose you are observing rare waterfowl, aren't you? What a splendid telescope. Yes, that is the... an excellent telescope. Oh, tell me, who are you working for this time? Russia, China, America? When we last met, you were very inconvenient for us, K\u00f6rten. I hope you are clear about that. Listen, I don't work for anyone. I give you my word. Your word. Oh, if that isn't a radio, I want to drop dead right now. That's enough. Please. Send in your life jackets, OK? There, and you wear this. Come on, children. George, what are you doing this afternoon? It's my business. I was just thinking, because we found something interesting. What is it? That's our secret. We're behind the hill at the end of the beach. You can think again. It's really a great thing we've found there. George, come on! I don't understand you, Curtin, doing business with them again. Hello? Karner? Mr. Johnson, how nice to hear your voice again. I have the feeling that your work has entered an unpleasant phase, my dear sir. Bad luck for you. Oh, and one more thing. You will no longer receive Mr. Curtin on the frequency. Johnson, listen! We are well aware that you will be inconvenienced. First of all, we will have a thorough talk. I don't think anyone has been here for ages. You can't even see the end. You have to go a long way in here. Come on! This is not a cave. This is a tunnel that someone has built. It is incredibly long. He's probably going down to the sea. What is that? It's a dog. Hey, who are you? Who does it belong to? I don't know, maybe someone on the beach. Timmy! Timmy, where are you? That's George. I must be hearing something. So that's their great secret. Come on! Timmy, how many times have I told you not to chase rabbits? It doesn't feel dangerous when I tell you something. Would a good dog do that? You're a bad one. Come on, do I have to tell you everything a thousand times? Hello, George. Dick. So this is Timmy. How do you know his name? You just called him. He gave us a big fright. He's really sweet, George. Is he yours? Yes. And why haven't we seen him in the house yet? Father has forbidden me to keep him, but a boy in the village looks after him for me. I'd rather starve than give him away. And besides, I'm keeping him. him either. Oh, now I get it. So that's why you run away so much. But you don't need to be afraid. We won't tell you your secret. Absolutely not, George. Does he promise me that? Yes, we promise. You like us just as much as you do. Yes. Friends? Friends. I didn't like the fact that we were enemies anyway. What I wanted to tell you, George, is that the tunnel we found is not a normal tunnel. We didn't get very far, but we found some steps. Yes, they lead straight into the ground. And in the direction of Tumir. you're coming out with of course come on hello kids but it's now with my invitation we'd better go before he asks us what we're looking for down here yes I'm hungry anyway okay we're coming make yourselves comfortable then sit down guilty that's a bit messy Look at the telescope. Oh yes, that's my hobby. I watch birds. Karen Island. Oh, I can see Uncle Quentin's tower quite clearly. A kind of raven. Pyrocorax. Rare shorebirds. I've spotted a few of them on the island. Well, and of course I've seen you too. So, how's your father? My father? Oh yes. He's almost ready, he said. Oh, is that him? Yes. Good old Quentin. Er, well. Perhaps you could help me set the table. Some cake and biscuits. are in there I'm not doing the t up there now you'll find everything in the bottom compartment my boy excuse me oh my goodness the aunt I mean my aunt aunt john she's coming for tea have you forgotten you surely know her like that yes of course yes the days are really lovely unfortunately soon gone I'm sorry goodbye and thank you very much Well, but... It was really stupid of us. I'm sorry. Thank you anyway. Goodbye. Well, maybe another time. Who's Aunt Joan? We don't have an Aunt Joan at all. Of course not, but he said he knew her anyway. He's only pretending to be a friend of Father's. But I've never seen the guy before. You shouldn't have told him Father was nearly finished. You know it's a secret. I'm sorry, George. I didn't think of that. Don't you think you're exaggerating a bit, George? No, not at all. I think she's right. You probably didn't see what was in the closet. There was a radio, a pretty big one. Oh man! Really excellent, Kirk. Well, I'm sorry. You left so suddenly. I couldn't ask any questions. I heard everything I wanted to know. So Professor Kirin is, as the boy said, almost finished. Don't be so dogged, Kirk. You've got a lot to do tonight. Yes, maybe. But I still think we're worrying too much. As long as Uncle Quentin still signals on time. It's almost half past ten. Wow, that plane is flying low. It's flying over the island. Have you seen his signal yet, children? No, not yet. It should be coming any minute. Come on, father, go. Go! There! One, two, three. It's all right, George. Nothing's wrong. It's all right, Aunt Fanny. Good. Now off to bed with you. March, march. Phew, that's a relief. But first thing in the morning I'll look at the tower with binoculars. Good night. Good night. Night. Night. Professor Kirin, I presume. Who the hell are you? I don't think you know me. My name is Johnson. I'm from the Research Department. Thank God, Mr. Johnson. At first I thought you were some kind of... I was at the Research Department. Because recently... I have decided to open my own ministry. Do you understand? And this is the beginning, Professor. The best one I can think of. Here on Kirin Island. no danger. Trust in us, we'll get to work, who can resist us? Five friends, that's us. Julian, Dick and Ed, George and Tim, like the dog. Five friends, that's us. We'll come quickly, whenever you want us to. We're coming quickly And we're already here We're here"

And when I asked who she was, she told me, Maya, no other bee could be as beautiful as you.  could ever be like Maya. Maya, why you question me? Why is no, no answer for a bee? My, my, she's always in a pretty pickle. Maya, helping someone else's little Maya. Maya, everyone loves Maya. Maya.  Maya, Maya, Maya, come tell us what you see. Just to think of boxing.  That's Maya coming to see us. Ah! Ah! Whoop! Oh! Oh! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Hey, more careful, please. What are you doing? Hang on a sec. And... Ah! Ah! Ha ha ha! Oh! Oh! Oh! Ouch!  Oh, there's Alexander. Well, how are you, Alexander? So-so, I guess. Oh, I see you have another piece of cheese. Yes, and you can smell how good it is. Well, I must be going. Goodness, what a painful business. Lately everything has seen such an effort. I hope he's not sick. He's not getting any younger.  Oh, oh, Mr. Turtle, how are you? Oh, it's you, Maya. Hello. I'm fine, thanks. Hello, Maya. Isn't it a beautiful day? Yes, Flip, it's lovely. He helps well. Quickly, Mr. Turtle, help him, please. I'm coming, I'm coming. Here goes. Help, help, help. There you are.  I was close. I'm glad I could help you. Without your help, I would surely have drowned. Those were very big jumps. I don't think so. I've always managed them before. I wonder if I'm getting old. It could be arthritis. Oh, these old bones, they don't work so well anymore. Hello, Frida. I've been looking for you everywhere. At last.  What do you mean? I'm Maya. What's that I see? Buck and Maya? Hey, hey, hey. What's this all about? Huh? Oh, forgive me, my darlingest. My eyes are getting worse and worse. I mixed you up with Maya. I know that you're short-sighted, but to do something like this to me, no, really. Oh,  Oh, Freda, please, there's no reason to start crying. You know, I very nearly lost my life today through my short-sightedness. I only just managed to escape.  The fly-sorto missed me by a hair's breadth. Ah! Ah! That's been my nightmare for years. Just think when he's usually so fast. Oh! I've got the feeling my hearing's getting worse. I can't hear the high notes at all anymore. Terrible! That would be... Do you realise she's also out of tune? Gracious, what could be worse than a violin virtuoso who's such a...  I can't believe I'm losing her hearing. One of them can't jump and the others are losing their sight and hearing. Just wait for me, Baba. No, no, no! Just wait for me. No! First you must tell me what you want.  I'll tell you something, my darling. You must stop chasing me like this. My heart won't take it. Strange. I'm also completely out of breath. Oh, dear. I hope it's not old age creeping up on us, Kurt. I fear it may be. For weeks now when I work, I feel a stabbing here in my shoulder. Oh, dear. Assuage my shoulder for me a bit. Yes.  Yes, of course. So now I'll make a good herb tea for the tourists. Ah, that was nice. Come, I'll do it for you too. Hmm, you do that well. Ah, seems as if everybody's sick. Oh no, wrinkles! Oh, I can't believe it!  I won't believe it. I won't believe it. What's the matter, this butterfly? Have you hurt yourself? I have to do something about it once. I'm terrible. I must ask her again. Perhaps she's really sick. Please tell me, don't you feel very well? What? Oh! I'm just putting on my beauty mask. I'm sorry. I hope I didn't frighten you. You're doing what?  discovered wrinkles on my face. This is a mixture of honey and sunflower seed oil. That'll get rid of wrinkles? Of course it will. It's a famous old remedy. Explain to me, do wrinkles hurt you? What a silly question. When you've given your life to beauty as I have, they can hurt you most terribly. Would you like to try some? Oh, no. Oh, yes. I had the same confidence as you have just a couple of years ago. But you lose that as soon as you lose your beauty. Please.  Believe me. It's really most odd. Suddenly all my friends are worried that they're beginning to get old. And I can see it. They can't do the things they used to be able to do.   Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  Oh, yes, that's right. Not so fast, Flip. I can't fly as well as I could. What do you mean? For someone your age, you still fly extremely well. Here, it's easier if we help each other. Ah, here at last. What do you want?  Oh, it's Flip, if I'm not mistaken. Quite right, quite right. What's that? Who did you buy? I said quite right! Ah-ha! And who's this we've got here? Madam Butterfly, how nice of you to visit. HE LAUGHS Would you like another cup of tea? No, thank you. I can't understand how in my young days I didn't like to eat cheese at all. Just so's how choosy the young people are. You please don't feel obliged.  No, nice and soft. Just right for my poor old teeth. By the way, Miss Thekla, wouldn't you like to play a little something for us while we eat? Miss Thekla? Oh, dear poor Alexander. He can't see very well or hear very well anymore. Only eat cheese. There's Maya over there. Maya! Oh, of course. Now I remember. Maya can't play anymore because she's got rheumatism. It's pointless explaining to him. We all of us know that we're getting old, but he's totally gaga. What's that? You want some gorgonzola? I don't have any in this mislob.  until the autumn festival, huh? I'm not so interested in eating up all my good food. It's such a pity about poor old Alexander. We're still a couple of spring chickens compared to him. Once upon a time, that's how all fairy tales start. Where are the days when we were still young, Maya? Now be careful not to strain yourself. You're old enough.  Oh, as long as I can still fly, Flip, life is not so bad. Oh, oh, oh, I can't stay up. I'm dropping lower and lower. Oh! Why don't you watch out? You're blocking the road. You could at least apologize. And who are you, anyway? I don't recognize you. What's that? You don't know us anymore? You're a very old... That's true, but surely you should recognize us. They're the three ladybird children. Can you really not remember us, Maya?  Yes, I do. Well, sort of. Think back. Well, of course, now I remember. You must be the three ladybird children. But goodness, you're so big. Well, we're old enough, aren't we? We've grown big and you've grown old. That's the only difference. Now, you listen to me. Even if you have grown up, you've still got absolutely no right to call me an old bee. Do you understand? Aha, that's how I remember her. She was always fighting. She really has got very old.  You can put her down now. Have a look in the water. Can you see what an old bag of bones you've turned into? What's going on? How can you be so small? You were giants. At least twice as tall as I am. Let's see if we can wake her up.  Whether you're big or small, you're always causing trouble. Oh! Oh, I dreamed that.  Good, I was right. It was just a nasty dream. I'm not an ugly old bee. And I can still fly perfectly. My wings are as good as ever. Hello, Maya. Would you like to dance? Yes.  I'm so glad that was a dream. I can fly as well as ever and that's never going to change. And that I know for absolute certain. At least I don't notice my getting old. Oh!  Oh, Dr. Snail. I see you're in a good mood as usual. Oh, yes. But please excuse me for sitting on your house. That's all right. I was just having a good think about something that's been bothering me a lot, so I went into my shell. I'm worried about the health of our insects. Dr. Snail, Dr. Snail. We're calling Dr. Snail. Yes, yes, Snail, Dr. Snail. What is it? Alexander the Great has suffered a great misfortune. Really? Oh, please, Dr. Snail, won't you go and see him? Very well. Careful, Carly, he's rolling down.  Come on, have a good trip. Why do I always get into trouble? This is no time for foolishness. Alexander, what's the matter? It happened when I wanted to pick up my cheese. All of a sudden I experienced always terrible pain in my hip.  Possibly a hernia. Lift him up carefully and put him down over there. Hopefully we won't have to operate on you, if we're lucky, that is. Would you believe it? He picks up a piece of cheese and gives himself a hernia. I'll have to do a thorough examination. You remember what I was saying, Maya? For some time now I've been scratching my head about the health of a lot of insects around here. Why not examine everyone? I'll go and call them. Very good, we will check.  We'll take it upon ourselves to instruct everybody to come here. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Today's examinations have borne out what I suspected, which is that the physical condition of most of you leaves a lot to be desired. If you don't do something about it, you'll all end up as old crocs. You see, that's where the pain in your shoulder comes from. Could I be old already?  It's terrible. Now, everyone listen here. As from today and three times a day, you will all do physical exercises to slow down the process of growing old. As you know, physical exercise is the best way to do that. That's a good idea. I'll begin with some stomach exercises so that I can eat much more pollen. You'll definitely come to a bad end. If you carry on like that, one day you'll fall out of the air because your wings won't be able to support you. I hope that'll make you think, Willie. To tell the truth, it won't. It'll still be...  It'll be a long time before I'm too heavy to fly. That's no reason for not doing a bit of training. I won't have to train, will I? Oh, yes, you will. It's never too early to start, my dear Maya. Ah, I think you're right. When I think of what happened, perhaps I've become too fat and slow to get out of the way in time. We'll start right away with the exercises. An easy one to begin with. First we run as fast as we can, and then...  Every four or five steps we jump into the air like rabbits. Any questions? That sounds too terrible. Do you think we'll manage? I'll practice in my web. Run and jump, must we? No, Doctor, it's too difficult. No, Doctor, it's too difficult.  All right, then. Forget it. And in a few months, you'll all be crippled and lame. Help! Help! A fire! Fire! Somebody's house is on fire! Where's the fire? Where's the fire? Look, you can see the smoke. I'll tell you where the fire is. Alexander, it's your own house that's going up in flames. What? You're saying my house is on fire? My house is on fire? Doctor, we can't do any training today. We must go and put Alexander's fire out. That is good training. I don't know if I...  I can't help with my body out of condition like this. Enough of your silly jokes, there's no time for that. Everybody down to the stream and fill buckets. Make a long chain to Alexander's house and toss them along. Help Alexander! It's terrible! Fire out! Fire out! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!  In such cases, I'm very useful. My valuable staff! My valuable staff!  This is a good opportunity to give a demonstration of my  aerobatic flying. I went not too far into the flames. Don't stop now, everyone. The fire's nearly out.  Oh, I'm afraid we've arrived too late. The fire's out. Yes, sir. The fire is out. My friends, how on earth am I going to thank you? I'm sorry.  Thank you for us if I didn't spread any further. Anyone on his own would have been helpless against that inferno. That's true. It shows we should all stick together. I'm always here, always on duty. Anyone can ask me for help any time. It's such a pity that the heat warped the bow of my violin. Can you stop showing off like that? Ow! And how's your hip doing, if I may ask? Good heavens, it was hurting me so terribly, and now I don't feel a single thing. Hooray! I'm happy!  I feel fine again. I'm in top form. So do I. Hurrah! I don't think we need your physical exercises anymore, Doctor. I think the fire proved to us we're in good condition and still feeling young. That's how I feel. Yes, I don't think we have any need of those exercises. Yes, we don't have to hop around like rabbits. There you have it, Doctor Snail. Everyone's feeling well and in top condition. That's where you're wrong. We find this special strength only in emergencies. No, you must train. Now, what?  We're all going to run over to that corner there and back. So please, everyone, take your places. We'll start at once. But first, a small and tasty token of my appreciation. No thanks, all the same. Goodbye. Since you're running, run as far as the big holly tree. Then at least it'll do you good. I'm sure you'll agree, Doctor, there's nothing better than...  to keep the body healthy. Have a slice, dear friends. This is one of the most delicious varieties. Goodbye to you. Do you understand why nobody likes my cheese, Dr. Snail? Doctor, my hip! Oh, I never thought cheese would make me run. That cheese in the middle of the meadow every day we'd see everybody run.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  \u00a9 BF-WATCH TV 2021  \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446.",
        "translated": "Once upon a time, you see, in a strange land not far away, I met for chance a little bee, upon a most unusual day. And when I asked who she was, she told me, Maya, no other bee could be as beautiful as you. could ever be like Maya. Maya, why you question me? Why is no, no answer for a bee? My, my, she's always in a pretty pickle. Maya, helping someone else's little Maya. Maya, everyone loves Maya. Maya. Maya, Maya, Maya, come tell us what you see. Just to think of boxing. That's Maya coming to see us. Ah! Ah! Whoop! Oh! Oh! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Hey, more careful, please. What are you doing? Hang on a sec. And... Ah! Ah! Ha ha ha! Oh! Oh! Oh! Ouch! Oh, there's Alexander. Well, how are you, Alexander? So-so, I guess. Oh, I see you have another piece of cheese. Yes, and you can smell how good it is. Well, I must be going. Goodness, what a painful business. Lately everything has seen such an effort. I hope he's not sick. He's not getting any younger. Oh, oh, Mr. Turtle, how are you? Oh, it's you, Maya. Hello. I'm fine, thanks. Hello, Maya. Isn't it a beautiful day? Yes, Flip, it's lovely. He helps well. Quickly, Mr. Turtle, help him, please. I'm coming, I'm coming. Here goes. Help, help, help. There you are. I was close. I'm glad I could help you. Without your help, I would surely have drowned. Those were very big jumps. I don't think so. I've always managed them before. I wonder if I'm getting old. It could be arthritis. Oh, these old bones, they don't work so well anymore. Hello, Frida. I've been looking for you everywhere. At last. What do you mean? I'm Maya. What's that I see? Buck and Maya? Hey, hey, hey. What's this all about? Huh? Oh, forgive me, my darlingest. My eyes are getting worse and worse. I mixed you up with Maya. I know that you're short-sighted, but to do something like this to me, no, really. Oh, Oh, Freda, please, there's no reason to start crying. You know, I very nearly lost my life today through my short-sightedness. I only just managed to escape. The fly-sorto missed me by a hair's breadth. Ah! Ah! That's been my nightmare for years. Just think when he's usually so fast. Oh! I've got the feeling my hearing's getting worse. I can't hear the high notes at all anymore. Terrible! That would be... Do you realise she's also out of tune? Gracious, what could be worse than a violin virtuoso who's such a... I can't believe I'm losing her hearing. One of them can't jump and the others are losing their sight and hearing. Just wait for me, Baba. No, no, no! Just wait for me. No! First you must tell me what you want. I'll tell you something, my darling. You must stop chasing me like this. My heart won't take it. Strange. I'm also completely out of breath. Oh, dear. I hope it's not old age creeping up on us, Kurt. I fear it may be. For weeks now when I work, I feel a stabbing here in my shoulder. Oh, dear. Assuage my shoulder for me a bit. Yes. Yes, of course. So now I'll make a good herb tea for the tourists. Ah, that was nice. Come, I'll do it for you too. Hmm, you do that well. Ah, seems as if everybody's sick. Oh no, wrinkles! Oh, I can't believe it! I won't believe it. I won't believe it. What's the matter, this butterfly? Have you hurt yourself? I have to do something about it once. I'm terrible. I must ask her again. Perhaps she's really sick. Please tell me, don't you feel very well? What? Oh! I'm just putting on my beauty mask. I'm sorry. I hope I didn't frighten you. You're doing what? discovered wrinkles on my face. This is a mixture of honey and sunflower seed oil. That'll get rid of wrinkles? Of course it will. It's a famous old remedy. Explain to me, do wrinkles hurt you? What a silly question. When you've given your life to beauty as I have, they can hurt you most terribly. Would you like to try some? Oh, no. Oh, yes. I had the same confidence as you have just a couple of years ago. But you lose that as soon as you lose your beauty. Please. Believe me. It's really most odd. Suddenly all my friends are worried that they're beginning to get old. And I can see it. They can't do the things they used to be able to do.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey Oh, yes, that's right. Not so fast, Flip. I can't fly as well as I could. What do you mean? For someone your age, you still fly extremely well. Here, it's easier if we help each other. Ah, here at last. What do you want? Oh, it's Flip, if I'm not mistaken. Quite right, quite right. What's that? Who did you buy? I said quite right! Ah-ha! And who's this we've got here? Madam Butterfly, how nice of you to visit. HE LAUGHS Would you like another cup of tea? No, thank you. I can't understand how in my young days I didn't like to eat cheese at all. Just so's how choosy the young people are. You please don't feel obliged. No, nice and soft. Just right for my poor old teeth. By the way, Miss Thekla, wouldn't you like to play a little something for us while we eat? Miss Thekla? Oh, dear poor Alexander. He can't see very well or hear very well anymore. Only eat cheese. There's Maya over there. Maya! Oh, of course. Now I remember. Maya can't play anymore because she's got rheumatism. It's pointless explaining to him. We all of us know that we're getting old, but he's totally gaga. What's that? You want some gorgonzola? I don't have any in this mislob. until the autumn festival, huh? I'm not so interested in eating up all my good food. It's such a pity about poor old Alexander. We're still a couple of spring chickens compared to him. Once upon a time, that's how all fairy tales start. Where are the days when we were still young, Maya? Now be careful not to strain yourself. You're old enough. Oh, as long as I can still fly, Flip, life is not so bad. Oh, oh, oh, I can't stay up. I'm dropping lower and lower. Oh! Why don't you watch out? You're blocking the road. You could at least apologize. And who are you, anyway? I don't recognize you. What's that? You don't know us anymore? You're a very old... That's true, but surely you should recognize us. They're the three ladybird children. Can you really not remember us, Maya? Yes, I do. Well, sort of. Think back. Well, of course, now I remember. You must be the three ladybird children. But goodness, you're so big. Well, we're old enough, aren't we? We've grown big and you've grown old. That's the only difference. Now, you listen to me. Even if you have grown up, you've still got absolutely no right to call me an old bee. Do you understand? Aha, that's how I remember her. She was always fighting. She really has got very old. You can put her down now. Have a look in the water. Can you see what an old bag of bones you've turned into? What's going on? How can you be so small? You were giants. At least twice as tall as I am. Let's see if we can wake her up. Whether you're big or small, you're always causing trouble. Oh! Oh, I dreamed that. Good, I was right. It was just a nasty dream. I'm not an ugly old bee. And I can still fly perfectly. My wings are as good as ever. Hello, Maya. Would you like to dance? Yes. I'm so glad that was a dream. I can fly as well as ever and that's never going to change. And that I know for absolute certain. At least I don't notice my getting old. Oh! Oh, Dr. Snail. I see you're in a good mood as usual. Oh, yes. But please excuse me for sitting on your house. That's all right. I was just having a good think about something that's been bothering me a lot, so I went into my shell. I'm worried about the health of our insects. Dr. Snail, Dr. Snail. We're calling Dr. Snail. Yes, yes, Snail, Dr. Snail. What is it? Alexander the Great has suffered a great misfortune. Really? Oh, please, Dr. Snail, won't you go and see him? Very well. Careful, Carly, he's rolling down. Come on, have a good trip. Why do I always get into trouble? This is no time for foolishness. Alexander, what's the matter? It happened when I wanted to pick up my cheese. All of a sudden I experienced always terrible pain in my hip. Possibly a hernia. Lift him up carefully and put him down over there. Hopefully we won't have to operate on you, if we're lucky, that is. Would you believe it? He picks up a piece of cheese and gives himself a hernia. I'll have to do a thorough examination. You remember what I was saying, Maya? For some time now I've been scratching my head about the health of a lot of insects around here. Why not examine everyone? I'll go and call them. Very good, we will check. We'll take it upon ourselves to instruct everybody to come here. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Murdered? Who put in murder? I know it was. Only a shotgun blast can make a hole that large. What you got down here? Your DOA's a fugitive named Billy Lucas. Murder weapons bagged and tagged, and you shoot her. Standing there next to my cruiser. All I got's a name, Erica Rockler. She called it in and waited. What's she doing?  She did pull the trigger. That's what she said. I put her name on the air, I just waited for the priors. Thanks, Donnie. Slam dunk. We got this. Thanks, fellas. Good luck. So, uh, this is Rockwell. I'm Detective Williams. This is my partner, Detective Torres. You want to tell us what happened? I do Q&A at your precinct with my attorney present. Having said this, if you continue, you'll be violating my rights. An educated consumer, huh? I watch a lot of TV. All right, in between killing people. Is that a question?  Williams. Not even close. Hey, Natasha. Who are you giving the car to? What's going on? Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You did. You left him in the truck. Sure, you can come down, pick it up anytime you need. No, that would be no trouble at all, baby. I'll see you then. Au revoir. Woo! Yo, Ed. She left her glasses in the truck, all right? She's gonna come to pick them up. What she left was a big, flat hand. Come on, man. What, are you slipping now or something?  You don't get it? What, me? Lieutenant, we got our purpose. Her name is Erica Rockwell. She admitted to it, and we got the weapon. And? It's an easy close, Lou. I don't know, gentlemen. What about motive? Oh, come on. We don't need that. Take her statement, get her signature, and it is a done deal. Oh, just like that. Meanwhile, I heard that a bent warrant went out on Billy Lucas two weeks ago. Federal case. Mixed bag of charges. Counterfeiting to attempted murder. What's her role?  this where does she fit in what's her background well she's not talking until the lawyer shows up but all we got on her right now is that she's from north carolina she's got three priors for b and e and a gun charge and does she do any time no they would drop all right well you see where we might have some blanks to fill in here gentlemen so why don't we do that and then we can wrap it up all right yeah uh well well well what do we got here i'm miles jordan mcgrath was new york attorney she's ready to cooperate fully  Okay, I'll bite first. New York attorney. What, you got one in every state now? Not yet, but if business picks up, I'll need more. What is this business that you do? Fugitive retrieval. That almost sounds professional, huh? But let's be real, you're nothing but a damn bounty hunter. When the bell jumper turned nasty, I had to take him down. It was him or me. Do I have stupid written on my face? You expect me to buy that? No, you just don't like it. Well, that too. You see, you bounty hunters...  are not professionals. You don't even know what the hell you're doing out there. You're out of line, detective. My client came into town yesterday. She had certified copies of the bail agreement. She came in and she checked in with the desk sergeant downstairs. She went by the book. There is no book. That is the problem. So what really happened, Erica? He spooked you and then what? Boom, you had to shoot him? Is that what happened? I don't spook easily and I don't get paid on corpses. Look, he took my gun, he had me on the ground, he was going to fire. I had no choice. Right, right. So how would you...  you able to track him down so fast? Criminals are creatures of habit. Lucas had a thing for a hooker, so I just passed some cash around and waited for a nibble. So who ratted him out? Some washed out skank on Times Square. She must have sold me out because a clown knew I was coming. What's her name? Crystal. Crystal what? Chandelier. How the hell am I supposed to know? She's a hooker. For a price, she'd be any name you wanted her to be. Enough, Lennon. You make a decision. If you charge my client, we'll cut her loose.  Lieutenant. Yeah, well, that's it, gentlemen. Check the desk, Sergeant, and see if her story holds up. Lieutenant. No, what, Williams? Whether you like it or not, bounty hunting's a legal occupation. They are dangerous amateurs, Lieutenant. What about the people's rights? Futurists don't have any rights. They hand them over to the bail bondsman, who in turn gives it to the bounty hunter. Look, a man is dead. Now, he may have been a criminal, but she's the one that took his life. Yes, which only goes to support the argument that things went wrong.  bad towards the end, Suarez. Now, she had a lot to gain by bringing Lucas in alive. That's a hell of a way to make a living. What do we do now? Well, we make sure that CSU and the coroner agree on trajectory load and buckshot spray. We cross every T dot every I. Sorry I'm late. Don't sweat it, you cubs. Cooper asked for me? She did indeed. Well, what'd you tell her? Female problems. What? Cubs is a myriad of ills. This way nobody asked me, Jack. So where were you anyway? My attorneys.  anything wrong who's catching your turn i got the last marino fourth squad yep okay you'll be right there i got a shooting tommy it's a cop it's like a service all right  Any of you not here as part of the investigation, leave now. You're destroying the crime scene. Look, how about I take the body? Sure. Officer Donahue? Yeah. You need a few minutes or can we do this in... No, no, look, the quicker the better. Now, how soon before the wagon gets here? I don't want Vincent's wife seeing him like this. It should be here soon. So what happened? We worked a late tour. I drop him off as usual. I go home to crash. Camille, that's his wife. She calls me from her job. She's hysterical and in a panic. What about? She says they're talking on the phone and, uh...  Suddenly he yells at somebody, and then the phone went dead. She kept calling back, but there was no answer. So that's when you came over to check it out? Yeah, right, and I get here, and, uh... Take your time. Uh, the door was open, and, uh, the mess and everything, and... Yes, it was, uh... Um, single shot to the head, close range. There was powder burns around the wound. I checked his pulse. I used my cell.  to call it in. Nothing's been touched. Was there anything missing? His gun. I don't know what else. You're gonna have to ask Camille. Hey, Matt. Yeah, what you got? Camille, take a look. Okay, Wyler, I need pictures. All angles. Right here. Hey. Hello. And hello to you, too. Have a seat. You're looking good, girl. Thank you. Is this what you need? Yeah. I'm always leaving those somewhere.  Yo, my man, I hate to say this, but it looks like old girl was right. Really? Yeah. Ah, Natasha, this is my partner, Eddie Torres. Hi. This is G's French teacher. Uh-huh. Right. Uh, you know what? I gotta fuck, right? Nice to meet you. My man. Joe, anyway, um... I'm out of here, Williams. What'd you do? Me? Nothing. Don't let him break you, honey. He'll be back on the street in no time.  Didn't they tell you that you can go? So why don't you go? I'm after Lucas's pal, Kevin Swain. Wanted you to know, just in case. Who was that? Some trouble. Well, I'm gonna let you get back to work, okay? All right, so listen. What we should do, right? What I think we should do, right, we should meet tonight, go have dinner, it's a nice place.  Hello, Alex. Will you come? I'm gonna see if they lock you up, Rock. Even if I have to do it myself. Nobody's called me that in a long time. You murdered Billy Lucas. Who, Benny? Listen, I'm warning you. Stay away from Kevin Swain. He's mine. Unless he's in shackles. He's up for grabs. No, not this time. We'll go way back, you and me. I don't want to see you get hurt. I touched him, really.  The thing about it is not to be trusted. These are two detectives working on the case. Alex Pratt, Deputy U.S. Marshal. How's it going? So what's this all about? Erica Rockler. The lieutenant was telling me that so far this looks clean. What are you saying, that it's not? I know it's not. Rock used to be one of us. She worked for the government. She was a marshal. And a good one, too. Until she lost a witness in a Treasury case. The two men suspected of...  orchestrating that particular horror show, with Billy Lucas and Kevin Swain. So you think that it's revenge? Absolutely. She lost her witness and her career, not revenge. I'd say that's mild. Yes, sir. All righty, then. The feds say they're going to send over that file on Kevin Swain.  as soon as possible. Which means never. You got it. So BCI says the man's got 14 priors for forgery, bond instead of $2 million, and like Lucas, a warrant was issued two weeks ago. If Erica bags him, that's 200 Gs in her pocket. That's a big payday. She's got a score to settle with this Lucas guy. Yeah, but we don't have any evidence to support murder. Motive, Ed. She lied to us. All right, fine. Why don't we start with her snitch? Erica says that she set her up, so maybe she'll want to ask why. All right, we got a girl by the name of...  name of Crystal Wade, 110th and Pleasant. Where have you been? Ow! You're hurting me! Where's Lucas? We have a meet in two hours. I'm dead. What? How? Some bitch came sniffing around looking for both of you, so I called Lucas and told him about it. You said him? No, I didn't. I swear I didn't.  He told me to page her, get her to come to the club. I just did what he said. I swear I did. Who is she? Her name's Erica. The cops locked her up. Where are you going? Shut up. What about me? I'm going with you. No, you're not. Yes, I am. Don't make this hard a swing. You won't survive. Shoot and kill. Whatever.  It's you I need a lot. Hey, hold it! Back up! Drop it! Put it down. He's mine.  Mrs. Vincent. I'm sorry about your loss. Camille, these are the detectives that'll be working the case. They're gonna find a bastard. Now, you were on the phone when this happened, is that right? He always called me when he worked nights. And let me know he was on the phone.  All right. And what did you hear? A crash. Like something broke. Then Todd yelled and the phone went dead. Do you remember what he yelled? Hey. That's it? Was your husband suffering from depression? What difference does that make? I'm just covering all the bases, Donahue. You should know that. Ma'am, was he having problems on the job? No. My husband was not unhappy, and he was not...  crazy. Someone killed him or don't you care? Nice technique, detectives. It's a hell of a way to treat one of your own. You went for the books, kid. How's that? Bench warrant bonded for two mil. Uncle Sam must want you bad. I want to make a call. I'm entitled to a call. That's my right. Sure, no problem. I mean, as soon as we process.  just these other charges. Murder, fake money. I mean, that pretty much guarantees you life. What do you want? Where'd you get the money? What do I get? Oh, the mercy of the court and a smile on my face. Sweeten the deal. I'll lead you right to him. Meets in an hour, Riverside Underpass. Me with who? Deal first. No, you're in no position to bargain, baby. Well, maybe you should look at these C-notes again, baby. They're supposed to be counterfeiting.  It's counterfeit proof. Tell you what, why don't you call the feds? I bet they make a deal. We'll see. So, Lieutenant, you think we can swing this? It's worth a shot. I'm gonna talk to the state's attorney and see what we have to offer. Don't do this, Lieutenant. It's a mistake. You can't play federal games with local talent. Your opinion doesn't count. And I'm doing you a favor by even allowing you in here, Ms. Rockler. Lieutenant, please, let me in.  Let me take him in. Justice can sort out the rest. What you really want? You pal Pratt and the feds tell a difference. I knew Alex Pratt would fill you in. He used you. Really? How? By getting me out of the way. See, my motive is strictly money. His is prestige. He brings Swain in first. Hell, even Jana Reno would have to take notice. Let me take him in. I have to surrender him to the sheriff to collect my fee. Sorry, this is going to go down our way. Set it up, Williams. Yes, ma'am.  Listen, Erica... It's okay, Williams. I already know how to bend over. Can you hear me?  How's it going, Bates? I heard your legal battle has escalated. Yeah, that's why I'm here. My buyer's real interested in your plates. Of course. Come on, you're not gonna try to jack the price up on me, are you? Kevin, the free market is not for neophytes. I mean, you're in trouble. You need this deal.  I don't. Unless Bates says something concrete, he's gonna walk. Yeah, but you know he's gonna be careful. I gotta get out of town. I'll let you know. Company. Damn, he made us. Let's go. The terrorists.  What the hell is she doing here? What the hell are you doing? Getting my money. Let's go. Move it now, Kate. Do not shoot. Herb is unarmed. Go. Go. Come on. Come on. U.S. forces. Back off, Bill. This is a federal matter. It's Swain in the band. He is a protected witness. Back off.  What the hell are you doing? My job. Get inside. Get inside, Cal. What's going on? Hey, you! Two years' work down the drain because your detectives couldn't master Surveillance 101. Watch how you talk about my men, Pratt, all right? And you're in no position to throw stones because you didn't even tell me that there was a federal operation going on in my jurisdiction. It wasn't my call. I protect the witness. That's it. You're a son of a bitch, Alex.  Kenneth Swain murdered a witness under our protection, and you gave that lowlife snitch a deal. You have no evidence to prove that, and frankly, Rock, if you remember, there is nothing more important than the national interest. You already lost your store over this. Let it go. I need some air. Oh, yeah. Look, I don't like this any more than you do, but the fact is, we need bait to get Russell Bates. That money hits the streets, we won't recover for years. Yeah, right.  So you're saying this promotion that you get for bringing him in is just gravy, right? Spare me the soapbox, detective. You're willing to make a deal with Swain to get it baked yourself. I was ready to send him to jail, not to some beach with a new idea and a pocket full of money. Most criminals who enter the program do time first. He's not going to do a day in time if it's up to you. I mean, besides, we've got solid proof against your boy for murder. A man can't stand trial if he no longer exists. Lou, come on. Oh, please, let it go, Torres. We should have processed him while we had him. Possessions, $9.  to the law. Hey, Matt. The, um, paraffin test on Officer Vincent came back inconclusive. CSU said there were too many astringent chemicals present. Like what? Bleach would do it. Industrial strength cleaners. Suspicious enough that his hands were washed. Yeah, well, not if he just came out of the shower and was washing dishes. Yeah, right. Thanks. Thank you. Let's get out of here, huh?  Is Detective Williams here? He'll be down in a sec. Park it. So, what'd you do this time? Gave a damn. I knew the system wasn't perfect, but I thought it worked. You're a cop? Not anymore. I don't want to end up a drunk or playing with my gun in the dark.  Sorry. Don't waste that on me. You save that for the poor slobs like Williams. They need your pity. I haven't known J.C. very long, but he does not seem like the kind of man anyone should feel sorry for. Not yet, but it's coming. He's got that cop disease. Look, I don't know what you're talking about, but if J.C. wants to tell me something, I'd prefer he told me on his own. Then you're in for a long wait. You see, cops don't talk to anybody else but cops. Wives and girlfriends, they don't know Jack until they...  come home and there's brains splattered all over the wall. You're exaggerating. Why is that? Look, the job comes first. Canceled dates, unanswered questions, mood swings, and if you have kids with cops, you can count on raising them your own damn self. There's one thing I know about JC, is that he takes a big part in raising his son. Well, have you ever talked to the boy's mother? I'm sure she might sing a different tune. You obviously don't know.  I know them better than you do, and I just met them. Give J.C. a message for me. Tell him not to let it get to him. Not let what get to him? If he wants you to know, he'll tell you.  Something wrong? Hey, yeah, um, I'm sorry. I meant to call you, I just... That's okay, don't worry about it. What happened? Just this case I'm working on, you know, the whole thing went bust. It's leaving a bad taste in my mouth. Well, I'm a good listener if you want somebody to talk to. Oh, thanks. Okay, well, uh, call me later? Will do. Oh, yeah, that...  Um, that girl that was here earlier... Who, Erica? Yeah. She told me to tell you, don't let it get to you. She said that, huh? Yeah, she's wanting to talk. Did she say where she was going? Sorry. I'll see you later. Listen, I just want you to know I really did want to see you tonight. Yeah, me too. All right.  Measure for measure Your love's so much pleasure Like a haunted melody You came inside and you captured me So, how do you want to handle this, Tommy? We've got to close this case on soon. Well, it's a suicide. Donnie, who tried to cover for his partner, took his gun from the scene.  If we go for Warren, every cop on the squad is gonna be out by blood. He'd be stupid to keep it anyway. The wife. The wife's the weak link. We get her alone, it's over. We sure we want to do this. It means donning his career. And his wife's pension. I don't know what I'm supposed to think or feel. Well, I know this. Just because he pulled the trigger doesn't mean the job didn't kill him. I don't know.  You know how to love me. I'm alright. I'm fresh away. You know how to love me. Tonight, when I want to sing. You know how to love me.  May I help you? You and I? Yeah. Come in. So, um... I thought you were going to North Carolina. I don't like the country. So? So why do you live there, then? It's cheap. Cheap like what? What are you looking for, Williams? You have no business poking around in my fire! Pratt gave this to me.  okay what does he have against you anyway I was his partner and I never told him that our witness had contact with the relative I lost my job and Alex lost a promotion so is that the reason why your witness was killed oh yeah he loved his wife and they knew it she refused to go into the program you can't see  that a blamer all you get for your civic duty is a new birth certificate and twelve hundred dollars a month for a year and a half so why did he come forward because he was a damn fool who didn't know you witness a murder you mind your own business you don't make a description you don't finger the bastards and line up you don't give up your life because it's the right thing to do okay  Come on. It's okay. Come here. Don't be nice to me, Will. No, come here. You don't need to cry, all right? It's gonna be fine. All right? Okay? Okay?  What's it gonna be? I can't pretend Don't you wanna be Holdin' fresh All night and don't let go Don't let go You have me to get Don't let go I didn't tell you  I know you think that we move too soon, it would all end. I live in misery when you're not around. And I won't be standing still till the chicken's all found. There'll be some love making, heart breaking, soul shaking. Oh, love making.  Heartbreaking, soul shaking What you gonna be? Cause I can't pretend Don't you wanna be Don't you wanna be A woman's friend Hold me tight and don't let go Don't let go I have the right to lose You got the right You got the right I said you got the right to lose Woo!  Country roads, yeah, yeah. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Don't let go. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. What's up, young? What's up? Sweeney and two deputy marshals were ambushed. Pratt's on my ass, and the feds are trying to take over my precinct. Other than that, Williams, it's quiet. Wait, did you see him?  When? Around 11 o'clock last night. A woman matching Erica's description was seen at the hotel. I want an all-point out on her, and I want this mess cleared up before the brass door call on me. No, it wasn't her. Williams, I know how you feel. She's been through it and then some, but now it's out of my hands. No, Lieutenant, I know that it wasn't her, because she was with me last night. She was with you? Yeah, she was with me. Where is she now?  She's at a hotel. He'll get her to us. What's the problem? What? What? I told you everything that I know. He yelled, hey, and we got that. Now, there wasn't much missing from your place. Maybe they got scared when they shot my husband. Why was Officer Vincent seeing a police rank?  I thought that was confidential. It is. That's why I'm asking. I don't know. You didn't ask? He said it was for the job. For the job or because of it. See, cops lose it all the time. Need to get it off their chest. We cheat on our spouses. We drink. Even eat our guns. We got a saying around the squad. If you can get two shots off before the end, you're a real hard ass. See?  He didn't kill himself. Then how did he get powder burns on his hand? We have a test for that, Camille. We checked his reports. He hadn't fired his weapon in weeks. And there was broken glass outside the window. If the perps broke in, the glass would have been on the floor. We're not stupid. He said you wouldn't know.  What time did you leave the precinct? After everything that's happened. You can't believe that I did this. Well, you didn't pull the trigger because Detective Williams said you were together. Then why am I here? Because you went to the Regent Hotel. See, Swain was being held there before being moved to a safe house, and somehow, you're pretty the last found out. I wasn't there. Yes, you were, because somebody ID'd your photo. If I was with Williams, how do you explain it?  Revenge? Change the record. This one's a little tired. You know, you're not the only one with a grudge, Erica. As of yesterday, Russell Bates... Williams, get back here. Prove it. Oh, I will. And I can't... Man, I got this. I got it. I guess I know how you feel, huh? Betrayed. Used. Then you get angry, right?  And payback is the only thing that you can think about until she becomes a bitch all of a sudden. That's about right, isn't it? I mean, you played me well, girl. I mean, who else better to vouch for you than a cop? It wasn't like that. But this time I'm going to play you, all right? Now, you're right. We can't prove it. You're going to have to cooperate. And trust me when I tell you, you will when I'm done with you. I'm out of here. You sit your ass right here. Are you?  went to Bates, you told him where to find Swain. You told him how the marshals operate. He ends up dead. So whether or not you gave it to him for free or you sold it to him, you did it, we know it, and you're going to pay for that. How, Williams? I'm going to go to Bates, just like you did. And I'm going to tell him we got you on two counts of conspiracy to murder U.S. Deputy Marshals and one Kevin Swain. Then I'm going to tell him it's just a matter of time before you serve him up to us on the planet.  Who think you're posturing? I will, Willie. And you're willing to take that risk. I don't believe you. It's not your style.  All right. Good. The meat's set. Remember, bait's no joke. You just better make sure you cover my ass. You're a protected witness, whether I like it or not. I told you before, we'll do anything to get baits, even give you a deal. Listen, the purse is wired in the lining. The pager is the backup. Now, the range isn't good on either one, so...  We're gonna have to be close. Just get Bates to say something incriminating, and then we'll come in. I know what you mean. Williams. Can I have a minute? I'm never meant to hurt you. I just couldn't let Swain get away again. Let me ask you something. If you get away with doing the same thing, then what makes you feel better?  What makes you different than him? Look, I couldn't take the national interest anymore. The snitches and the finks, double-dipping between federal agencies. We spent over $100 million on snitches last year. Swain was the last straw. That's very noble, Erica. Why don't you write a book? Huh. The reason why I chose you is because I knew you wouldn't leave me twisting in the wind. I knew you were a good cop.  their mouths about us. It's not my morals that I question. It's just my taste. Move your hands a little to the left. I might get something out of this too.  She's clean. For a woman, you travel very light. Makeup's in the car. You want it? Some men appreciate a sharp wit in a female. I'm not one of them. When we talked yesterday, you didn't seem to mind. I don't know what you're talking about. I gave you a freebie. You said butchers instead of somebody subtle. Sure.  So get to the point. I got cops asking me questions. I don't like it. Slippery son of a bitch. He hasn't said a damn thing we can use. I could give you a loan to help you straighten out your problems. Fortunately, don't keep any cash in your pocket. Come on, do something, Rock. How much we talking here? I gave you Swain's whereabouts. Two marshals got killed. How much you need? Enough to get lost.  fair enough go with my associate he'll take care of you what the hell is she doing you're proud your witness is leaving she left one of the transmitters in the office we have to stay in range so where are we going anyway um  You know what? I know this city like the back of my hand. If you take Houston, you're gonna hit traffic, so maybe we should turn up this street a bit. Now, which street did she say, man? I've lost her, really. I'm static. Okay, I got a little belt. Don't worry about it.  Yes, sir, I understand. Okay. Uh, don't take this personally. I don't like people sitting behind me. If you could just move over, I'd appreciate it. Yeah, sure. Where is she? Come on, is there anything coming through, yeah? Nothing.  There they are. All units, suspect sight. Alley behind the mountain, chambers. Out of the car! Let's go, let's go! Where is she? Get up! Where is she? Out of the car, will you? Hey, fuck! There we are.  What the hell is she? He hear me talking to you? Say, see. Move, Edmund.  You're done now. Sit down, Don, if you... Unless you want to tell your story to one police plaza. What difference does it make who I talk to? If the girls don't report that you staged this whole thing, the brass won't be satisfied with just your resignation.  Did Officer Vincent take his own life? Maybe you forgot what it's like out there on the street. And hell, you gold shields don't show up till the smoke's cleared anyway. We still got our shaft. Believe me. You don't see some guy beating the crap out of his wife. Or watch some kid blow her brains out, and you never find out why. So he eats his own life.  gun and leads you to clean up his mess he was my partner what's this officer Todd Vincent died from a gunshot wound fired by an unknown assailant  Hey, bonjour. If you're looking for G, he went that way with Nikki. No, I thought I'd come see you and say hello. Hello. So, um, how have you been? I've been all right. I haven't seen you around.  in a while. Yeah, um, you know that woman who was working on that case? Yeah, Erica. Well, she was killed. JC, I'm so sorry. Yeah, me too. So I needed to, you know, just take time away. I know we didn't get off to the best start, so what I want to try to do is make it up to you. I don't think that'd be a good idea. Why not?  JC, I don't always know what I want, but I know what I don't want. What, Jess? Second place. Not over a woman, not over a job, nothing. Who's talking about second place? And then, you know, people settle. And that's not me. So... Prince?

Murdered? Who put in murder? I know it was. Only a shotgun blast can make a hole that large. What you got down here? Your DOA's a fugitive named Billy Lucas. Murder weapons bagged and tagged, and you shoot her. Standing there next to my cruiser. All I got's a name, Erica Rockler. She called it in and waited. What's she doing? She did pull the trigger. That's what she said. I put her name on the air, I just waited for the priors. Thanks, Donnie. Slam dunk. We got this. Thanks, fellas. Good luck. So, uh, this is Rockwell. I'm Detective Williams. This is my partner, Detective Torres. You want to tell us what happened? I do Q&A at your precinct with my attorney present. Having said this, if you continue, you'll be violating my rights. An educated consumer, huh? I watch a lot of TV. All right, in between killing people. Is that a question? Williams. Not even close. Hey, Natasha. Who are you giving the car to? What's going on? Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You did. You left him in the truck. Sure, you can come down, pick it up anytime you need. No, that would be no trouble at all, baby. I'll see you then. Au revoir. Woo! Yo, Ed. She left her glasses in the truck, all right? She's gonna come to pick them up. What she left was a big, flat hand. Come on, man. What, are you slipping now or something? You don't get it? What, me? Lieutenant, we got our purpose. Her name is Erica Rockwell. She admitted to it, and we got the weapon. And? It's an easy close, Lou. I don't know, gentlemen. What about motive? Oh, come on. We don't need that. Take her statement, get her signature, and it is a done deal. Oh, just like that. Meanwhile, I heard that a bent warrant went out on Billy Lucas two weeks ago. Federal case. Mixed bag of charges. Counterfeiting to attempted murder. What's her role? this where does she fit in what's her background well she's not talking until the lawyer shows up but all we got on her right now is that she's from north carolina she's got three priors for b and e and a gun charge and does she do any time no they would drop all right well you see where we might have some blanks to fill in here gentlemen so why don't we do that and then we can wrap it up all right yeah uh well well well what do we got here i'm miles jordan mcgrath was new york attorney she's ready to cooperate fully Okay, I'll bite first. New York attorney. What, you got one in every state now? Not yet, but if business picks up, I'll need more. What is this business that you do? Fugitive retrieval. That almost sounds professional, huh? But let's be real, you're nothing but a damn bounty hunter. When the bell jumper turned nasty, I had to take him down. It was him or me. Do I have stupid written on my face? You expect me to buy that? No, you just don't like it. Well, that too. You see, you bounty hunters... are not professionals. You don't even know what the hell you're doing out there. You're out of line, detective. My client came into town yesterday. She had certified copies of the bail agreement. She came in and she checked in with the desk sergeant downstairs. She went by the book. There is no book. That is the problem. So what really happened, Erica? He spooked you and then what? Boom, you had to shoot him? Is that what happened? I don't spook easily and I don't get paid on corpses. Look, he took my gun, he had me on the ground, he was going to fire. I had no choice. Right, right. So how would you... you able to track him down so fast? Criminals are creatures of habit. Lucas had a thing for a hooker, so I just passed some cash around and waited for a nibble. So who ratted him out? Some washed out skank on Times Square. She must have sold me out because a clown knew I was coming. What's her name? Crystal. Crystal what? Chandelier. How the hell am I supposed to know? She's a hooker. For a price, she'd be any name you wanted her to be. Enough, Lennon. You make a decision. If you charge my client, we'll cut her loose. Lieutenant. Yeah, well, that's it, gentlemen. Check the desk, Sergeant, and see if her story holds up. Lieutenant. No, what, Williams? Whether you like it or not, bounty hunting's a legal occupation. They are dangerous amateurs, Lieutenant. What about the people's rights? Futurists don't have any rights. They hand them over to the bail bondsman, who in turn gives it to the bounty hunter. Look, a man is dead. Now, he may have been a criminal, but she's the one that took his life. Yes, which only goes to support the argument that things went wrong. bad towards the end, Suarez. Now, she had a lot to gain by bringing Lucas in alive. That's a hell of a way to make a living. What do we do now? Well, we make sure that CSU and the coroner agree on trajectory load and buckshot spray. We cross every T dot every I. Sorry I'm late. Don't sweat it, you cubs. Cooper asked for me? She did indeed. Well, what'd you tell her? Female problems. What? Cubs is a myriad of ills. This way nobody asked me, Jack. So where were you anyway? My attorneys. anything wrong who's catching your turn i got the last marino fourth squad yep okay you'll be right there i got a shooting tommy it's a cop it's like a service all right Any of you not here as part of the investigation, leave now. You're destroying the crime scene. Look, how about I take the body? Sure. Officer Donahue? Yeah. You need a few minutes or can we do this in... No, no, look, the quicker the better. Now, how soon before the wagon gets here? I don't want Vincent's wife seeing him like this. It should be here soon. So what happened? We worked a late tour. I drop him off as usual. I go home to crash. Camille, that's his wife. She calls me from her job. She's hysterical and in a panic. What about? She says they're talking on the phone and, uh... Suddenly he yells at somebody, and then the phone went dead. She kept calling back, but there was no answer. So that's when you came over to check it out? Yeah, right, and I get here, and, uh... Take your time. Uh, the door was open, and, uh, the mess and everything, and... Yes, it was, uh... Um, single shot to the head, close range. There was powder burns around the wound. I checked his pulse. I used my cell. to call it in. Nothing's been touched. Was there anything missing? His gun. I don't know what else. You're gonna have to ask Camille. Hey, Matt. Yeah, what you got? Camille, take a look. Okay, Wyler, I need pictures. All angles. Right here. Hey. Hello. And hello to you, too. Have a seat. You're looking good, girl. Thank you. Is this what you need? Yeah. I'm always leaving those somewhere. Yo, my man, I hate to say this, but it looks like old girl was right. Really? Yeah. Ah, Natasha, this is my partner, Eddie Torres. Hi. This is G's French teacher. Uh-huh. Right. Uh, you know what? I gotta fuck, right? Nice to meet you. My man. Joe, anyway, um... I'm out of here, Williams. What'd you do? Me? Nothing. Don't let him break you, honey. He'll be back on the street in no time. Didn't they tell you that you can go? So why don't you go? I'm after Lucas's pal, Kevin Swain. Wanted you to know, just in case. Who was that? Some trouble. Well, I'm gonna let you get back to work, okay? All right, so listen. What we should do, right? What I think we should do, right, we should meet tonight, go have dinner, it's a nice place. Hello, Alex. Will you come? I'm gonna see if they lock you up, Rock. Even if I have to do it myself. Nobody's called me that in a long time. You murdered Billy Lucas. Who, Benny? Listen, I'm warning you. Stay away from Kevin Swain. He's mine. Unless he's in shackles. He's up for grabs. No, not this time. We'll go way back, you and me. I don't want to see you get hurt. I touched him, really. The thing about it is not to be trusted. These are two detectives working on the case. Alex Pratt, Deputy U.S. Marshal. How's it going? So what's this all about? Erica Rockler. The lieutenant was telling me that so far this looks clean. What are you saying, that it's not? I know it's not. Rock used to be one of us. She worked for the government. She was a marshal. And a good one, too. Until she lost a witness in a Treasury case. The two men suspected of... orchestrating that particular horror show, with Billy Lucas and Kevin Swain. So you think that it's revenge? Absolutely. She lost her witness and her career, not revenge. I'd say that's mild. Yes, sir. All righty, then. The feds say they're going to send over that file on Kevin Swain. as soon as possible. Which means never. You got it. So BCI says the man's got 14 priors for forgery, bond instead of $2 million, and like Lucas, a warrant was issued two weeks ago. If Erica bags him, that's 200 Gs in her pocket. That's a big payday. She's got a score to settle with this Lucas guy. Yeah, but we don't have any evidence to support murder. Motive, Ed. She lied to us. All right, fine. Why don't we start with her snitch? Erica says that she set her up, so maybe she'll want to ask why. All right, we got a girl by the name of... name of Crystal Wade, 110th and Pleasant. Where have you been? Ow! You're hurting me! Where's Lucas? We have a meet in two hours. I'm dead. What? How? Some bitch came sniffing around looking for both of you, so I called Lucas and told him about it. You said him? No, I didn't. I swear I didn't. He told me to page her, get her to come to the club. I just did what he said. I swear I did. Who is she? Her name's Erica. The cops locked her up. Where are you going? Shut up. What about me? I'm going with you. No, you're not. Yes, I am. Don't make this hard a swing. You won't survive. Shoot and kill. Whatever. It's you I need a lot. Hey, hold it! Back up! Drop it! Put it down. He's mine. Mrs. Vincent. I'm sorry about your loss. Camille, these are the detectives that'll be working the case. They're gonna find a bastard. Now, you were on the phone when this happened, is that right? He always called me when he worked nights. And let me know he was on the phone. All right. And what did you hear? A crash. Like something broke. Then Todd yelled and the phone went dead. Do you remember what he yelled? Hey. That's it? Was your husband suffering from depression? What difference does that make? I'm just covering all the bases, Donahue. You should know that. Ma'am, was he having problems on the job? No. My husband was not unhappy, and he was not... crazy. Someone killed him or don't you care? Nice technique, detectives. It's a hell of a way to treat one of your own. You went for the books, kid. How's that? Bench warrant bonded for two mil. Uncle Sam must want you bad. I want to make a call. I'm entitled to a call. That's my right. Sure, no problem. I mean, as soon as we process. just these other charges. Murder, fake money. I mean, that pretty much guarantees you life. What do you want? Where'd you get the money? What do I get? Oh, the mercy of the court and a smile on my face. Sweeten the deal. I'll lead you right to him. Meets in an hour, Riverside Underpass. Me with who? Deal first. No, you're in no position to bargain, baby. Well, maybe you should look at these C-notes again, baby. They're supposed to be counterfeiting. It's counterfeit proof. Tell you what, why don't you call the feds? I bet they make a deal. We'll see. So, Lieutenant, you think we can swing this? It's worth a shot. I'm gonna talk to the state's attorney and see what we have to offer. Don't do this, Lieutenant. It's a mistake. You can't play federal games with local talent. Your opinion doesn't count. And I'm doing you a favor by even allowing you in here, Ms. Rockler. Lieutenant, please, let me in. Let me take him in. Justice can sort out the rest. What you really want? You pal Pratt and the feds tell a difference. I knew Alex Pratt would fill you in. He used you. Really? How? By getting me out of the way. See, my motive is strictly money. His is prestige. He brings Swain in first. Hell, even Jana Reno would have to take notice. Let me take him in. I have to surrender him to the sheriff to collect my fee. Sorry, this is going to go down our way. Set it up, Williams. Yes, ma'am. Listen, Erica... It's okay, Williams. I already know how to bend over. Can you hear me? How's it going, Bates? I heard your legal battle has escalated. Yeah, that's why I'm here. My buyer's real interested in your plates. Of course. Come on, you're not gonna try to jack the price up on me, are you? Kevin, the free market is not for neophytes. I mean, you're in trouble. You need this deal. I don't. Unless Bates says something concrete, he's gonna walk. Yeah, but you know he's gonna be careful. I gotta get out of town. I'll let you know. Company. Damn, he made us. Let's go. The terrorists. What the hell is she doing here? What the hell are you doing? Getting my money. Let's go. Move it now, Kate. Do not shoot. Herb is unarmed. Go. Go. Come on. Come on. U.S. forces. Back off, Bill. This is a federal matter. It's Swain in the band. He is a protected witness. Back off. What the hell are you doing? My job. Get inside. Get inside, Cal. What's going on? Hey, you! Two years' work down the drain because your detectives couldn't master Surveillance 101. Watch how you talk about my men, Pratt, all right? And you're in no position to throw stones because you didn't even tell me that there was a federal operation going on in my jurisdiction. It wasn't my call. I protect the witness. That's it. You're a son of a bitch, Alex. Kenneth Swain murdered a witness under our protection, and you gave that lowlife snitch a deal. You have no evidence to prove that, and frankly, Rock, if you remember, there is nothing more important than the national interest. You already lost your store over this. Let it go. I need some air. Oh, yeah. Look, I don't like this any more than you do, but the fact is, we need bait to get Russell Bates. That money hits the streets, we won't recover for years. Yeah, right. So you're saying this promotion that you get for bringing him in is just gravy, right? Spare me the soapbox, detective. You're willing to make a deal with Swain to get it baked yourself. I was ready to send him to jail, not to some beach with a new idea and a pocket full of money. Most criminals who enter the program do time first. He's not going to do a day in time if it's up to you. I mean, besides, we've got solid proof against your boy for murder. A man can't stand trial if he no longer exists. Lou, come on. Oh, please, let it go, Torres. We should have processed him while we had him. Possessions, $9. to the law. Hey, Matt. The, um, paraffin test on Officer Vincent came back inconclusive. CSU said there were too many astringent chemicals present. Like what? Bleach would do it. Industrial strength cleaners. Suspicious enough that his hands were washed. Yeah, well, not if he just came out of the shower and was washing dishes. Yeah, right. Thanks. Thank you. Let's get out of here, huh? Is Detective Williams here? He'll be down in a sec. Park it. So, what'd you do this time? Gave a damn. I knew the system wasn't perfect, but I thought it worked. You're a cop? Not anymore. I don't want to end up a drunk or playing with my gun in the dark. Sorry. Don't waste that on me. You save that for the poor slobs like Williams. They need your pity. I haven't known J.C. very long, but he does not seem like the kind of man anyone should feel sorry for. Not yet, but it's coming. He's got that cop disease. Look, I don't know what you're talking about, but if J.C. wants to tell me something, I'd prefer he told me on his own. Then you're in for a long wait. You see, cops don't talk to anybody else but cops. Wives and girlfriends, they don't know Jack until they... come home and there's brains splattered all over the wall. You're exaggerating. Why is that? Look, the job comes first. Canceled dates, unanswered questions, mood swings, and if you have kids with cops, you can count on raising them your own damn self. There's one thing I know about JC, is that he takes a big part in raising his son. Well, have you ever talked to the boy's mother? I'm sure she might sing a different tune. You obviously don't know. I know them better than you do, and I just met them. Give J.C. a message for me. Tell him not to let it get to him. Not let what get to him? If he wants you to know, he'll tell you. Something wrong? Hey, yeah, um, I'm sorry. I meant to call you, I just... That's okay, don't worry about it. What happened? Just this case I'm working on, you know, the whole thing went bust. It's leaving a bad taste in my mouth. Well, I'm a good listener if you want somebody to talk to. Oh, thanks. Okay, well, uh, call me later? Will do. Oh, yeah, that... Um, that girl that was here earlier... Who, Erica? Yeah. She told me to tell you, don't let it get to you. She said that, huh? Yeah, she's wanting to talk. Did she say where she was going? Sorry. I'll see you later. Listen, I just want you to know I really did want to see you tonight. Yeah, me too. All right. Measure for measure Your love's so much pleasure Like a haunted melody You came inside and you captured me So, how do you want to handle this, Tommy? We've got to close this case on soon. Well, it's a suicide. Donnie, who tried to cover for his partner, took his gun from the scene. If we go for Warren, every cop on the squad is gonna be out by blood. He'd be stupid to keep it anyway. The wife. The wife's the weak link. We get her alone, it's over. We sure we want to do this. It means donning his career. And his wife's pension. I don't know what I'm supposed to think or feel. Well, I know this. Just because he pulled the trigger doesn't mean the job didn't kill him. I don't know. You know how to love me. I'm alright. I'm fresh away. You know how to love me. Tonight, when I want to sing. You know how to love me. May I help you? You and I? Yeah. Come in. So, um... I thought you were going to North Carolina. I don't like the country. So? So why do you live there, then? It's cheap. Cheap like what? What are you looking for, Williams? You have no business poking around in my fire! Pratt gave this to me. okay what does he have against you anyway I was his partner and I never told him that our witness had contact with the relative I lost my job and Alex lost a promotion so is that the reason why your witness was killed oh yeah he loved his wife and they knew it she refused to go into the program you can't see that a blamer all you get for your civic duty is a new birth certificate and twelve hundred dollars a month for a year and a half so why did he come forward because he was a damn fool who didn't know you witness a murder you mind your own business you don't make a description you don't finger the bastards and line up you don't give up your life because it's the right thing to do okay Come on. It's okay. Come here. Don't be nice to me, Will. No, come here. You don't need to cry, all right? It's gonna be fine. All right? Okay? Okay? What's it gonna be? I can't pretend Don't you wanna be Holdin' fresh All night and don't let go Don't let go You have me to get Don't let go I didn't tell you I know you think that we move too soon, it would all end. I live in misery when you're not around. And I won't be standing still till the chicken's all found. There'll be some love making, heart breaking, soul shaking. Oh, love making. Heartbreaking, soul shaking What you gonna be? Cause I can't pretend Don't you wanna be Don't you wanna be A woman's friend Hold me tight and don't let go Don't let go I have the right to lose You got the right You got the right I said you got the right to lose Woo! Country roads, yeah, yeah. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Don't let go. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. What's up, young? What's up? Sweeney and two deputy marshals were ambushed. Pratt's on my ass, and the feds are trying to take over my precinct. Other than that, Williams, it's quiet. Wait, did you see him? When? Around 11 o'clock last night. A woman matching Erica's description was seen at the hotel. I want an all-point out on her, and I want this mess cleared up before the brass door call on me. No, it wasn't her. Williams, I know how you feel. She's been through it and then some, but now it's out of my hands. No, Lieutenant, I know that it wasn't her, because she was with me last night. She was with you? Yeah, she was with me. Where is she now? She's at a hotel. He'll get her to us. What's the problem? What? What? I told you everything that I know. He yelled, hey, and we got that. Now, there wasn't much missing from your place. Maybe they got scared when they shot my husband. Why was Officer Vincent seeing a police rank? I thought that was confidential. It is. That's why I'm asking. I don't know. You didn't ask? He said it was for the job. For the job or because of it. See, cops lose it all the time. Need to get it off their chest. We cheat on our spouses. We drink. Even eat our guns. We got a saying around the squad. If you can get two shots off before the end, you're a real hard ass. See? He didn't kill himself. Then how did he get powder burns on his hand? We have a test for that, Camille. We checked his reports. He hadn't fired his weapon in weeks. And there was broken glass outside the window. If the perps broke in, the glass would have been on the floor. We're not stupid. He said you wouldn't know. What time did you leave the precinct? After everything that's happened. You can't believe that I did this. Well, you didn't pull the trigger because Detective Williams said you were together. Then why am I here? Because you went to the Regent Hotel. See, Swain was being held there before being moved to a safe house, and somehow, you're pretty the last found out. I wasn't there. Yes, you were, because somebody ID'd your photo. If I was with Williams, how do you explain it? Revenge? Change the record. This one's a little tired. You know, you're not the only one with a grudge, Erica. As of yesterday, Russell Bates... Williams, get back here. Prove it. Oh, I will. And I can't... Man, I got this. I got it. I guess I know how you feel, huh? Betrayed. Used. Then you get angry, right? And payback is the only thing that you can think about until she becomes a bitch all of a sudden. That's about right, isn't it? I mean, you played me well, girl. I mean, who else better to vouch for you than a cop? It wasn't like that. But this time I'm going to play you, all right? Now, you're right. We can't prove it. You're going to have to cooperate. And trust me when I tell you, you will when I'm done with you. I'm out of here. You sit your ass right here. Are you? went to Bates, you told him where to find Swain. You told him how the marshals operate. He ends up dead. So whether or not you gave it to him for free or you sold it to him, you did it, we know it, and you're going to pay for that. How, Williams? I'm going to go to Bates, just like you did. And I'm going to tell him we got you on two counts of conspiracy to murder U.S. Deputy Marshals and one Kevin Swain. Then I'm going to tell him it's just a matter of time before you serve him up to us on the planet. Who think you're posturing? I will, Willie. And you're willing to take that risk. I don't believe you. It's not your style. All right. Good. The meat's set. Remember, bait's no joke. You just better make sure you cover my ass. You're a protected witness, whether I like it or not. I told you before, we'll do anything to get baits, even give you a deal. Listen, the purse is wired in the lining. The pager is the backup. Now, the range isn't good on either one, so... We're gonna have to be close. Just get Bates to say something incriminating, and then we'll come in. I know what you mean. Williams. Can I have a minute? I'm never meant to hurt you. I just couldn't let Swain get away again. Let me ask you something. If you get away with doing the same thing, then what makes you feel better? What makes you different than him? Look, I couldn't take the national interest anymore. The snitches and the finks, double-dipping between federal agencies. We spent over $100 million on snitches last year. Swain was the last straw. That's very noble, Erica. Why don't you write a book? Huh. The reason why I chose you is because I knew you wouldn't leave me twisting in the wind. I knew you were a good cop. their mouths about us. It's not my morals that I question. It's just my taste. Move your hands a little to the left. I might get something out of this too. She's clean. For a woman, you travel very light. Makeup's in the car. You want it? Some men appreciate a sharp wit in a female. I'm not one of them. When we talked yesterday, you didn't seem to mind. I don't know what you're talking about. I gave you a freebie. You said butchers instead of somebody subtle. Sure. So get to the point. I got cops asking me questions. I don't like it. Slippery son of a bitch. He hasn't said a damn thing we can use. I could give you a loan to help you straighten out your problems. Fortunately, don't keep any cash in your pocket. Come on, do something, Rock. How much we talking here? I gave you Swain's whereabouts. Two marshals got killed. How much you need? Enough to get lost. fair enough go with my associate he'll take care of you what the hell is she doing you're proud your witness is leaving she left one of the transmitters in the office we have to stay in range so where are we going anyway um You know what? I know this city like the back of my hand. If you take Houston, you're gonna hit traffic, so maybe we should turn up this street a bit. Now, which street did she say, man? I've lost her, really. I'm static. Okay, I got a little belt. Don't worry about it. Yes, sir, I understand. Okay. Uh, don't take this personally. I don't like people sitting behind me. If you could just move over, I'd appreciate it. Yeah, sure. Where is she? Come on, is there anything coming through, yeah? Nothing. There they are. All units, suspect sight. Alley behind the mountain, chambers. Out of the car! Let's go, let's go! Where is she? Get up! Where is she? Out of the car, will you? Hey, fuck! There we are. What the hell is she? He hear me talking to you? Say, see. Move, Edmund. You're done now. Sit down, Don, if you... Unless you want to tell your story to one police plaza. What difference does it make who I talk to? If the girls don't report that you staged this whole thing, the brass won't be satisfied with just your resignation. Did Officer Vincent take his own life? Maybe you forgot what it's like out there on the street. And hell, you gold shields don't show up till the smoke's cleared anyway. We still got our shaft. Believe me. You don't see some guy beating the crap out of his wife. Or watch some kid blow her brains out, and you never find out why. So he eats his own life. gun and leads you to clean up his mess he was my partner what's this officer Todd Vincent died from a gunshot wound fired by an unknown assailant Hey, bonjour. If you're looking for G, he went that way with Nikki. No, I thought I'd come see you and say hello. Hello. So, um, how have you been? I've been all right. I haven't seen you around. in a while. Yeah, um, you know that woman who was working on that case? Yeah, Erica. Well, she was killed. JC, I'm so sorry. Yeah, me too. So I needed to, you know, just take time away. I know we didn't get off to the best start, so what I want to try to do is make it up to you. I don't think that'd be a good idea. Why not? JC, I don't always know what I want, but I know what I don't want. What, Jess? Second place. Not over a woman, not over a job, nothing. Who's talking about second place? And then, you know, people settle. And that's not me. So... Prince? I'm Rosanna Scotto coming up next for the second time this week a serious accident at a New York airport we'll go inside the home of the cult of death new details on how they took their own lives plus Their eerie final message, why were they so concerned about a comet and some UFOs? Also ahead, bye-bye Heisman Trophy. The judge tells OJ to pay up. There's a videotape that might help police find Notorious B.I.G.'s killer. You'd better make sure you've paid all your tickets when you see this woman coming with her computer or else. Why Charles Manson doesn't want to be free, and Martin Luther King Jr.'s son goes face-to-face with James Earl Ray. Put down that remote. The 10 o'clock news is next. Welcome to my world.

        "original": " Wann immer sich ein Abenteuer lohnt, Angst und Schrecken kennen wir nicht, denn das sind wir gewohnt. Wo immer ein R\u00e4tsel zu l\u00f6sen ist, hoch in dem alten Schloss oder im Schwung, ja, Mest, f\u00fcnf Freunde, das sind wir. Julian, Dick und M, George und Tim, wie der Hund.  Und f\u00fcnf Freunde, das sind wir. Wir kommen schnell herbei, von immer hier ist Wolf. Und schon sind wir da.  Na, wie weit sind Sie, Mr. Rogers? Gleich fertig, Mrs. Kirin. Gut. George! George! Mach dich doch bitte schon mal fertig! Und vielleicht r\u00e4umst du auch dein Zimmer auf, Sie m\u00fcssen jetzt...  Ich will jeden Moment hier sein. Wie weit ist es noch, Julia? Vielleicht noch eine Meile. Vom Bahnhof aus sind wir ungef\u00e4hr f\u00fcnf Meilen gefahren. Ist ja nicht zu glauben. Endlich geht es mal bergab. Ist ja irre sch\u00f6n hier, was? Ja, ja, eine tolle Luft. Oh, guck doch mal das Meer. Das da dr\u00fcben ist bestimmt Cairn Island. Ja, m\u00fcsste es eigentlich. Was ist denn das f\u00fcr ein komischer Turm? Keine Ahnung.  Aber Ginny wei\u00df das bestimmt. Los, wir wollen wenigstens p\u00fcnktlich sein. George! Georgina! Also wirklich Georgina. Georgina! Komm her!  Das muss es sein. Los! Los! Entschuldigen Sie bitte. Ist das die Karen Cottage? Wieso willst du das wissen? Wir sind Verwandte von Georgina. Wie?  Ihre Mutter hat uns eingeladen. So eine lause Bande hat Professor Kirin noch gefehlt. Und drei mehr, die herumwimmeln, L\u00e4rm machen und ihn bei der Arbeit st\u00f6ren. Er hat verdammtes Gl\u00fcck, dass er meistens auf der Insel ist. Dann hat er wohl diesen komischen Turm gebaut. Ja, hat was mit seinem Experiment zu tun. Ist aber streng geheim, klar? Also seht euch vor und plaudert nicht mit fremden Leuten dar\u00fcber. Und lasst euch ja nicht in einem meiner Gem\u00fcsebeete erwischen.  Ach, da seid ihr ja. Ist aber sch\u00f6n, euch mal wiederzusehen. Tag, Tante Fanny. Ihr seid vielleicht gewachsen, seit ich euch das letzte Mal gesehen habe. Anne war damals noch ein Baby. Wartet mal, du m\u00fcsstest Julian sein und das ist Dick. Na, wie war die Reise? Einfach klasse, Tante Fanny. Die Fahrt vom Bahnhof hierher war doch prima. Ja, na gut. Ich habe beim Bahnhof angerufen, euer Gep\u00e4ck wird hergebracht. Stellt die Fahrr\u00e4der hinters Haus, gleich gibt es Tee. Ihr habt doch bestimmt auch Hunger.  Und Sie, stell dir vor, die beiden w\u00e4ren beinahe vom Rad gefallen. Besonders Andy war so schwach, dass er sich immer den Kopf gehalten hat. Der fehlt irgendwie Vitamine. Immer muss diese bl\u00f6de Witze machen. Ja, ja, eure Mutter hat mir schon gesagt, dass ihr solche Scherze treibt. Dann l\u00e4sst man jetzt gar nicht hin, dann wird er von selbst. Wunderbarer Nachmittag, Herr Johnson. Wunderbarer Nachmittag. Ja, muss ich auch sagen, Mr. Johnson. Ich hoffe, Sie haben gut gespeist. Passabel. Es wurde nur ein bisschen zu viel geredet.  Es wird Zeit f\u00fcr eine sch\u00f6ne Tasse B\u00fcrotee. Oh ja. Ja. \u00c4h, Miss Peters, ich muss unvorhergesehenerweise f\u00fcr ein paar Tage wegfahren.  Ich bin sicher, der Minister wird bis zu meiner R\u00fcckkehr auch ohne mich auskommen. Lassen Sie bitte den Wagen vorfahren, Miss Peters. Ja, Mr. Johnson. Dankesch\u00f6n. Ich habe mir gedacht, morgen fahren wir alle auf die Insel und essen zu Mittag mit Onkel Quentin. Klasse! Wo ist denn Georgina, Tante Fanny? Wir haben uns schon so auf sie gefreut. Wei\u00df auch nicht, wo sie ist.  sie ist. Also George verschwindet immer gerade dann, wenn sie es nicht soll. Aber wieso nennst du sie George? Sie will es so. Aber jeder denkt dann, sie ist ein Junge und kein M\u00e4dchen. Anscheinend will sie es nicht anders. Also ich m\u00f6chte nicht, dass man denkt, ich w\u00e4re ein Junge. Nein, nat\u00fcrlich nicht. Aber du bist ja auch nicht wie George. Ach, dass du dich auch mal sehen l\u00e4sst. Wir haben fast alles aufgegessen. Ich habe keinen Hunger. Danke, Mutter. Willst du nicht guten Tag sagen? Das sind N, Dick und Julian. Hallo. Tag.  Hallo. Hallo. Warum gehst du nicht mit ihnen raus, George, und zeigst ihnen ein bisschen die Gegend? Aber ich muss doch noch... Ja, was? Was musst du? Nichts. Dann ist's ja gut. Also ab mit euch. Ich r\u00e4um den Tisch ab. Danke f\u00fcr den Tee, Tante Fanny. Der Honig war auch ganz gut. Viel Spa\u00df, Kinder. H\u00f6rt mal. Hm? Kommt nicht zu sp\u00e4t zur\u00fcck. Nein, nein.  Tante Fanny hat gesagt, wir wollen morgen auf Onkel Quentys Insel fahren. Findest du das nicht klasse, Georgina? Mein Name ist nicht Georgina, ich hei\u00dfe George. Und die Insel geh\u00f6rt nicht ihm, sondern mir. Was regst du dich denn gleich auf? Sie geh\u00f6rt mir. Er hat sie mir geschenkt. Und jetzt arbeitet er da und l\u00e4sst mich \u00fcberhaupt nicht mehr hin. Aber wenn seine Arbeit ein so gro\u00dfes Geheimnis ist, warum macht er sie dann an einem Ort, wo jeder hinkommen kann, wenn er will? Du kannst es ja mal versuchen.  und die Klippen vor der Insel machen aus deinem Boot Kleinholz. Nur Vater und ich wissen, wie man da durchkommt. Er ist dort, weil er dicke Zeiten f\u00fcr seine Experimente braucht. Deshalb ist er auf meiner Insel. Also das f\u00e4nde ich auch prima, in einer eigenen Insel zu arbeiten. H\u00f6rt mal, ich habe jetzt was zu erledigen. Das geht nur mich was an, verstanden? Also kommt mir blo\u00df nicht hinterhergeschlichen, keiner von euch. Wir haben was Besseres zu tun. Das kann ja lustig werden mit dir. Na, f\u00fcr euch ist es ja nicht weiter schlimm, aber ich muss mit dir in einem Zimmer schlafen. Ich sage euch, das werden bestimmt zwei verdammt lange Wochen dauern.  Wochen f\u00fcr uns. Darf ich Ihnen noch eins bringen? Warum nicht, wenn Sie es bezahlen, gerne. Oh, das w\u00e4re mir ein Vergn\u00fcgen. Bitte? Danke. Timmy! Timmy! Oh, komm Timmy, komm! Na los, komm!  Na komm, mein Kleiner. Och, Timmy. Das ist die Kleine von Quentin Curran, nicht wahr? Ja. Sie ist wilder als ein Junge. Und die meisten hier sagen nur George zu ihr. Zum Wohl. Zum Wohl. Und das da ist ihr Hund. Der Professor.  wollte den Hund nicht im Haus haben. Sie sollte ihn weggeben, aber an dem K\u00f6ter h\u00e4ngt sie mehr als an allem anderen. Sagen Sie, wo ist Quentin jetzt? Ich habe ihn lange nicht mehr gesehen. Er hat sich fast v\u00f6llig auf die Insel zur\u00fcckgezogen, experimentiert. Er kommt \u00fcberhaupt nicht mehr r\u00fcber. Seine Frau bringt alles, was er braucht, zur Insel r\u00fcber. Vorher muss sie aber immer erst signalisieren, dass alles in Ordnung ist. Dann blinkt er dreimal vom Turm mit einer Taschenlampe. Jeden Morgen und jeden Abend um elf, danach k\u00f6nnen sie ihre Uhr stellen. Jeder hat seine Marotten. Ist das nicht verr\u00fcckt, so viel zu arbeiten?  Los, komm, hier gef\u00e4llt's mir. Wenn sich Georgina nur nicht so furchtbar bl\u00f6d benehmen w\u00fcrde. Sag blo\u00df George zu ihr. Wenn sie zuletzt oben ist, muss morgen das Eis bezahlen. Das sagst du nur, weil ich sowieso verliere.  Sieht hier aber sehr einsam aus. Hey, seht mal. Sieht aus, als w\u00e4re das eine gro\u00dfe H\u00f6hle. Kommt mal her. Da kann man nicht viel sehen. Kommt, wir gehen mal tiefer rein. Wir k\u00f6nnen doch nicht ohne Taschenlampe reingehen. Gut, dann gehen wir eben zur\u00fcck und holen uns eine. Daf\u00fcr reicht die Zeit nicht. Wisst ihr was, wir kommen morgen nochmal her und untersuchen sie.  dann klar die l\u00e4uft uns ja nicht weg wartet mal wir behalten das aber f\u00fcr uns ja dort hat ihr geheimnis und diese h\u00f6hle ist unser geheimnis okay hallo kinder ihr seid doch zu besuch auf karen kottisch nicht wahr ja das stimmt ist george nicht mitgekommen nein  Euer Onkel und eure Tante sind gute Freunde von mir. Wollt ihr morgen nicht bei mir Tee trinken? Naja, ich wei\u00df noch nicht, was wir morgen... Naja, ist ja egal. Kommt, wenn ihr Lust habt. Ich w\u00fcrde mich freuen. Auf Wiedersehen. Komischer Kauz. Das Wimmelt hier nur so von merkw\u00fcrdigen Leuten. Tante Fanny ist der einzig normale Mensch, der mir hier bisher begegnet ist. Onkel Quentin scheint ja wohl auch ein bisschen komisch zu sein.  Wenn wir morgen feststellen, wenn wir r\u00fcberfahren auf die Insel, nicht wahr? Darf ich hudern, George? Nein, die Klippen sind zu gef\u00e4hrlich, aber ablegen darfst du.  Da sitzen Kinder. Vater! Vater! Ist der immer in seinem Turm, Tante Penny? Nein, wenn wir ihn rufen, kommt er meistens sofort.  George, nimm die Jungs mit und seht, ob ihr ihn findet. Okay, komm. Ich freu mich schon aufs Essen. Vater! Vater! Mann, sowas hab ich ja noch nie gesehen. Seht euch das an! Sag mal, George, wei\u00dft du, was das f\u00fcr Dinger sind da oben am Turm? Ich k\u00f6nnte mir vorstellen, dass das irgendwas mit Sonnenenergie zu tun hat. Die Reflektoren oder wie das hei\u00dft, stehen vielleicht woanders.  Vater! Vater! Er ist wohl nicht da oben. Irgendwo muss er doch sein. Hier bin ich!  Professor Curran. Ihre Insel scheint ja ziemliche Aufmerksamkeit zu errichten.  Du bist gewachsen seit dem letzten Mal. Das war vor acht Jahren, Onkel Quentin. Ach wirklich? Dann war es ja wohl zu erwarten, oder was meint ihr? Wo treibst du dich denn im Moment auf der Insel rum? In den Kellern. In den Kellern? Unter den Ruinen, die Keller vom alten Schloss. Sag mal, ist das dein Geheimlabor? Ja, ja, wenn man will, kann man es.  zu nennen k\u00fcmmert sich georgia anst\u00e4ndig um euch sie hat uns raus gerudert um die gef\u00e4hrlichen klippen rum alle achtung die kann rudern besser als ein junge wei\u00df so jetzt muss ich erst mal zur\u00fcck ich habe da noch was zu kontrollieren danke f\u00fcr den nachschub george du kannst deine insel bald zur\u00fcck haben ich bin so gut wie fertig und vergisst die signale nicht ich mache mir sonst noch nicht denkt dran  Am\u00fcsiert euch noch gut. Also dann, Wiedersehen. Wiedersehen. Sieh da, sieh da. Eine reizende \u00dcberraschung, Sie wiederzusehen, Curtin. Johnson. Ich nehme an, Sie beobachten seltene Wasserv\u00f6gel, nicht wahr? Was f\u00fcr ein hervorragendes Teleskop. Ja, das ist der...  ein ausgezeichnetes Fernrohr. Ach, sagen Sie mir, f\u00fcr wen arbeiten Sie denn diesmal? Russland, China, Amerika? Damals, als wir uns das letzte Mal begegneten, waren Sie f\u00fcr uns sehr unbequem, K\u00f6rten. Ich hoffe, dass Sie sich dar\u00fcber klar sind. H\u00f6ren Sie, ich arbeite f\u00fcr niemanden. Ich gebe Ihnen mein Wort. Ihr Wort. Ach, wenn das kein Funkger\u00e4t ist, will ich sofort tot umfallen. So, das reicht. Lieber Herr K\u00f6rten,  Schickt eure Schwimmwesten rein, ja? So, und du tr\u00e4gst das. So, komm, Kinder. George, was machst du denn heute Nachmittag? Das ist ja wohl meine Sache. Ich habe nur gedacht, weil wir etwas Interessantes gefunden haben. Was denn? Das ist unser Geheimnis. Wir sind hinter dem H\u00fcgel am Ende vom Strand. Du kannst es dir ja nochmal \u00fcberlegen. Es ist wirklich eine tolle Sache, was wir da gefunden haben. George, komm!  Ich verstehe Sie nicht, Curtin, dass Sie mit denen wieder Gesch\u00e4fte machen. Hallo? Karner? Herr Johnson, wie sch\u00f6n, mal wieder Ihre Stimme zu h\u00f6ren. Ich habe das Gef\u00fchl, Ihre T\u00e4tigkeit ist in ein unangenehmes Stadium getreten, mein Verehrter. Pech f\u00fcr Sie. Ach, \u00fcbrigens noch was. Sie werden Mr. Curtin auf der Frequenz nicht mehr empfangen. Johnson, h\u00f6ren Sie!  Wir sind sich wohl dar\u00fcber klark\u00f6rten, dass sie Unannehmlichkeiten bekommen. Zuerst einmal werden wir beide uns gr\u00fcndlich unterhalten. Ich glaube, hier ist schon ewig keiner mehr gewesen. Man kann nicht mal das Ende sehen. Hier muss unheimlich weit rein gehen. Kommt! Das ist keine H\u00f6hle. Das ist ein Tunnel, den irgendjemand gebaut hat. Der ist ja unheimlich lang.  Er geht sicher weiter bis unten ans Meer. Was ist denn das? Das ist ein Hund. Hey, wer bist du denn? Wem der wo geh\u00f6rt? Keine Ahnung, vielleicht irgendjemanden am Strand. Timmy! Timmy, wo bist du? Das ist doch George. Ich h\u00f6re wohl nicht richtig. Das ist also ihr tolles Geheimnis. Kommt! Timmy, wie oft habe ich dir schon gesagt, dass du keine Kaninchen jagen sollst? F\u00fchlt sich nicht gef\u00e4hrlich an, wenn ich dir was sage.  Mach denn ein artiger Hund sowas? Du bist ein ganz schlimmer. Komm jetzt! Muss man dir denn alles tausendmal sagen? Hallo George. Dick. Das ist also Timmy. Woher wei\u00dft du denn seinen Namen? Du hast ihn doch gerade gerufen. Der hat uns einen gro\u00dfen Schreck eingejagt. Der ist ja wirklich s\u00fc\u00df, George. Geh\u00f6rt er dir? Ja. Und warum haben wir ihn noch nicht im Haus gesehen? Vater hat mir verboten, ihn zu behalten, aber ein Junge im Dorf versorgt ihn f\u00fcr mich. Ich w\u00fcrde lieber verhungern, als dass ich ihn weggeben w\u00fcrde. Und au\u00dferdem halte ich es um.  ihn auch nicht aus. Ach, jetzt kapier ich das. Deshalb haust du also so viel ab. Aber du brauchst keine Angst zu haben. Wir verraten dein Geheimnis nicht. Ganz bestimmt nicht, George. Verspricht er mir das? Ja, wir versprechen es. Uns gef\u00e4llt dir doch genauso gut wie dir. Ja. Freunde? Freunde. Ich fand das sowieso nicht gut, dass wir Feinde waren. Was ich dir noch sagen wollte, George, der Tunnel, den wir gefunden haben, das ist kein normaler Tunnel. Sehr weit sind wir nicht gekommen, aber wir haben ein paar Stufen gefunden. Ja, die f\u00fchren direkt in die Erde. Und in Richtung Tumir.  raus kommst du mit na klar kommt hallo kinder aber es ist nun mit meiner einladung gehen wir lieber bevor er uns fragt was sie hier unten suchen ja ich habe sowieso hunger okay wir kommen macht euch bequem dann setzt euch schuldig das ist ein bisschen unaufger\u00e4umt ist  Seht euch mal das Fernrohr an. Oh ja, das ist mein Hobby. Ich beobachte V\u00f6gel. Karen Island. Oh, ich kann ja Onkel Quentins Turm ganz deutlich sehen. Eine Art Raben. Pyrokorax. Seltene K\u00fcstenv\u00f6gel. Ein paar davon habe ich auf der Insel ersp\u00e4ht. Tja, und euch habe ich nat\u00fcrlich auch gesehen. Na, wie geht es denn deinem Vater? Meinem Vater? Ach ja. Er ist fast fertig, hat er gesagt. Ach, ist er das? Ja. Der gute alte Quentin. \u00c4h, nun ja. Vielleicht k\u00f6nntet ihr mir helfen, den Tisch zu decken. Ein bisschen Kuchen und Kekse.  sind dort drin ich mache inzwischen den t nicht da oben du findest alles in dem unteren fach mein junge entschuldigung ach du meine g\u00fcte die tante ich meine meine tante tante john sie kommt zum tee habt ihr das vergessen sie kennen sie doch sicher so ja nat\u00fcrlich ja die tage ist wirklich reizend leider gleich weg tut mir leid auf wiedersehen und vielen dank  Tja, aber... Es war wirklich bl\u00f6d von uns. Entschuldigen Sie bitte. Trotzdem vielen Dank. Auf Wiedersehen. Na ja, dann vielleicht ein andermal. Wer ist denn Tante Joan? Wir haben \u00fcberhaupt keine Tante Joan. Nat\u00fcrlich nicht, aber trotzdem hat er gesagt, er kennt sie. Der tut nur so, als w\u00e4re er ein Freund von Vater. Aber ich habe den Kerl noch niemals vorher gesehen. Du h\u00e4ttest ihm nicht sagen d\u00fcrfen, dass Vater fast fertig ist. Du wei\u00dft genau, dass das geheim ist. Tut mir leid, George. Ich habe nicht daran gedacht. Meinst du nicht, du \u00fcbertreibst die Sache ein bisschen, George? Nein, nicht nicht.  Ich glaube, sie hat recht. Du hast bestimmt nicht gesehen, was in dem Schrank war. Da war ein Funkger\u00e4t, ein ziemlich gro\u00dfes. Oh Mann! Wirklich ausgezeichnet, Kirk. Nun ja, es tut mir leid. Sie waren so pl\u00f6tzlich weg. Ich konnte \u00fcberhaupt keine Fragen stellen. Ich habe alles geh\u00f6rt, was ich wissen wollte. Professor Kirin ist also, wie der Junge sagte, fast fertig. Nicht so verbissen, Kirk. Sie haben noch eine Menge vor heute Nacht.  Ja, vielleicht. Trotzdem glaube ich, dass wir uns viel zu viel Gedanken machen. Solange Onkel Quentin noch p\u00fcnktlich signalisiert. Es ist gleich halb elf. Ui, das Flugzeug fliegt aber tief. Das fliegt ja \u00fcber die Insel. Habt ihr sein Zeichen schon gesehen, Kinder? Nein, noch nicht. Muss jeden Moment kommen. Mach schon, Vater, los.  Los! Da! Eins, zwei, drei. Alles in Ordnung, George. Nichts passiert. Es ist alles in Ordnung, Tante Fanny. Gut. Jetzt ab ins Bett mit euch. Marsch, marsch. Puh, da bin ich aber erleichtert. Aber morgen fr\u00fch werde ich als erstes den Turm mit einem Fernglas beobachten. Gute Nacht. Gute Nacht. Nacht. Nacht.  Professor Kirin, nehme ich an. Wer zum Teufel sind Sie? Ich glaube kaum, dass Sie mich kennen. Mein Name ist Johnson. Ich bin vom Forschungsministerium. Gott sei Dank, Mr. Johnson. Im ersten Moment habe ich geglaubt, Sie w\u00e4ren so etwas wie ein... Oder sollte ich besser sagen, ich war beim Forschungsministerium. Denn k\u00fcrzlich...  habe ich beschlossen, ein eigenes Ministerium aufzumachen. Verstehen Sie? Und dies ist der Anfang, Professor. Der beste, den ich mir denken kann. Hier auf Kirin Island.  keine Gefahr entgegen. Vertraut auf uns, wir packen's an, wer kann uns widerstehen? F\u00fcnf Freunde, das sind wir. Julian, Dick und Ed, George und Tim, wie der Hund. F\u00fcnf Freunde, das sind wir. Wir kommen schnell herbei, wann immer ihr es wollt.  Wir kommen schnell herbei Und schon sind wir da Sind wir da",
        "translated": "Whenever an adventure is worthwhile, we know no fear or terror, because we are used to it. Wherever there is a puzzle to solve, high up in the old castle or in the swing, yes, Mest, five friends, that's us. Julian, Dick and M, George and Tim, like the dog. And we are five friends. We come quickly, Wolf is always here. And we are already here. Well, how are you, Mr. Rogers? Almost ready, Mrs. Kirin. Good. George! George! Please get ready! And maybe you should tidy your room too, you have to... I want to be here any minute. How far is it, Julia? Maybe another mile. We drove about five miles from the station. It's unbelievable. Finally, we're going downhill. It's so beautiful here, isn't it? Yes, yes, great air. Oh, just look at the sea. That over there must be Cairn Island. Yes, it should be. What kind of strange tower is that? I have no idea. But Ginny probably knows that. Come on, let's at least be on time. George! Georgina! Really, Georgina. Georgina! Come here! That must be it. Come on! Come on! Excuse me. Is this Karen Cottage? Why do you want to know? We're relatives of Georgina. What? Her mother invited us. Professor Kirin was missing a lousy bunch like that. And three more who swarm around, make noise and disturb him at work. He's damn lucky that he's on the island most of the time. Then he must have built this strange tower. Yes, it has something to do with his experiment. But it's top secret, right? So be careful and don't chat about it with strangers. And don't get caught in one of my vegetable patches. Oh, there you are. It's nice to see you again. Hello, Aunt Fanny. You've grown a lot since I last saw you. Anne was just a baby then. Wait a minute, you must be Julian and this is Dick. So, how was the trip? Simply brilliant, Aunt Fanny. The journey from the station here was great. Yes, fine. I've called the station, your luggage is being brought here. Put the bikes behind the house, there will be tea soon. I'm sure you're hungry too. And you, just imagine, the two of them nearly fell off their bikes. Andy in particular was so weak that he kept holding his head. He's somehow lacking vitamins. She always has to make stupid jokes. Yes, yes, your mother told me that you joke like that. Then you don't let it go, it will happen on its own. Wonderful afternoon, Mr Johnson. Wonderful afternoon. Yes, I must say, Mr Johnson. I hope you ate well. Passable. There was just a bit too much talking. Time for a nice cup of office tea. Oh yes. Yes. Er, Miss Peters, I have to go away for a few days unexpectedly. I'm sure the Minister will manage without me until I return. Please have the car brought forward, Miss Peters. Yes, Mr Johnson. Thank you. I thought we'd all go to the island tomorrow and have lunch with Uncle Quentin. Great! Where's Georgina, Aunt Fanny? We've been looking forward to seeing her. I don't know where she is either. she is. Well, George always disappears when she shouldn't. But why do you call her George? She wants it that way. But then everyone thinks she's a boy and not a girl. Apparently she doesn't want it any other way. Well, I don't want people to think I'm a boy. No, of course not. But you're not like George either. Oh, I hope you show yourself sometimes. We've eaten almost everything. I'm not hungry. Thank you, Mother. Don't you want to say hello? This is N, Dick and Julian. Hello. Day. Hello. Hello. Why don't you go out with them, George, and show them around? But I've got to... Well, what? What do you have to do? Nothing. That's all right then. Off you go. I'll clear the table. Thanks for the tea, Aunt Fanny. The honey was quite good too. Have fun, children. Listen. Hm? Don't be late back. No, no. Aunt Fanny said we're going to Uncle Quenty's island tomorrow. Don't you think that's great, Georgina? My name isn't Georgina, it's George. And the island isn't his, it's mine. Why are you so upset? It's mine. He gave it to me. And now he works there and won't let me go at all. But if his work is such a big secret, why does he do it in a place where anyone can go if they want to? You can try it. and the cliffs off the island will turn your boat into splinters. Only Father and I know how to get through there. He's there because he needs a lot of time for his experiments. That's why he's on my island. I think it would be great, too, to work on my own island. Listen, I've got something to do now. That's only my business, got it? So don't sneak up on me, none of you. We've got better things to do. This could be fun with you. Well, it's not so bad for you, but I have to sleep in the same room as you. I'm telling you, it's going to take a long two weeks. Weeks for us. Can I get you another one? Why not, if you pay for it, I'd be happy to. Oh, that would be my pleasure. Please? Thank you. Timmy! Timmy! Oh, come on Timmy, come on! Come on, come on! Come on, little one. Oh, Timmy. That's Quentin Curran's little one, isn't it? Yes. She's wilder than a boy. And most people here just call her George. Cheers. Cheers. And that's her dog. The professor. didn't want the dog in the house. She should give him away, but she's more attached to the mutt than anything else. Tell me, where is Quentin now? I haven't seen him for a long time. He's withdrawn almost completely to the island, experimenting. He doesn't come over at all anymore. His wife brings everything he needs over to the island. But first she always has to signal that everything is OK. Then he flashes a flashlight three times from the tower. Every morning and every evening at eleven, they can set their clocks by that. Everyone has their quirks. Isn't it crazy to work so much? Come on, I like it here. If only Georgina wouldn't behave so terribly stupidly. Just call her George. If she's last up, she'll have to pay for the ice cream tomorrow. You're only saying that because I'm losing anyway. It looks very lonely here. Hey, look. It looks like a big cave. Come here. You can't see much. Come on, let's go deeper. We can't go in without a flashlight. OK, let's go back and get one. We don't have time for that. You know what, we'll come back tomorrow and examine it. then of course she won't run away from us just wait a minute we'll keep it to ourselves yes there is her secret and this cave is our secret okay hello children you are visiting karen kottisch aren't you yes that's right didn't george come with you no Your uncle and aunt are good friends of mine. Would you like to come and have tea with me tomorrow? Well, I don't know what we're going to do tomorrow... Well, it doesn't matter. Come if you feel like it. I'd be delighted. Goodbye. Strange guy. This place is full of strange people. Aunt Fanny is the only normal person I've met here so far. Uncle Quentin seems to be a bit strange too. If we discover it tomorrow when we go over to the island, right? Can I brood, George? No, the cliffs are too dangerous, but you can cast off. There are children sitting there. Father! Father! Is he always in his tower, Aunt Penny? No, when we call him he usually comes straight away. George, take the boys and see if you can find him. OK, come on. I'm looking forward to dinner. Father! Father! Man, I've never seen anything like it. Look at that! Tell me, George, do you know what those things are up there on the tower? I imagine it has something to do with solar energy. The reflectors or whatever they're called might be somewhere else. Father! Father! He's probably not up there. He has to be somewhere. I'm here! Professor Curran. Your island seems to be attracting quite a bit of attention. You've grown since the last time. That was eight years ago, Uncle Quentin. Oh really? Then it was to be expected, don't you think? Where are you hanging out on the island at the moment? In the cellars. In the cellars? Under the ruins, the cellars of the old castle. Tell me, is that your secret laboratory? Yes, yes, if you want, you can. to name Georgia takes good care of you she rowed us out around the dangerous cliffs well done she can row better than a boy knows so now I have to go back I still have something to check thanks for the supplies George you can have your island back soon I'm as good as finished and don't forget the signals I'm not going to worry otherwise remember Have a good time. Well, bye then. Bye. Look, look. A delightful surprise to see you again, Curtin. Johnson. I suppose you are observing rare waterfowl, aren't you? What a splendid telescope. Yes, that is the... an excellent telescope. Oh, tell me, who are you working for this time? Russia, China, America? When we last met, you were very inconvenient for us, K\u00f6rten. I hope you are clear about that. Listen, I don't work for anyone. I give you my word. Your word. Oh, if that isn't a radio, I want to drop dead right now. That's enough. Dear Mr. K\u00f6rten, Send in your life jackets, OK? There, and you wear this. Come on, kids. George, what are you doing this afternoon? It's my business. I was just thinking, because we found something interesting. What is it? That's our secret. We're behind the hill at the end of the beach. You can think again. It's really a great thing we've found there. George, come on! I don't understand you, Curtin, doing business with them again. Hello? Karner? Mr. Johnson, how nice to hear your voice again. I have the feeling that your work has entered an unpleasant phase, my dear sir. Bad luck for you. Oh, and one more thing. You will no longer receive Mr. Curtin on the frequency. Johnson, listen! We are well aware that you will be inconvenienced. First of all, we will have a thorough talk. I don't think anyone has been here for ages. You can't even see the end. You have to go a long way in here. Come on! This is not a cave. This is a tunnel that someone has built. It is incredibly long. He's probably going down to the sea. What is that? It's a dog. Hey, who are you? Who does it belong to? I don't know, maybe someone on the beach. Timmy! Timmy, where are you? That's George. I must be hearing something. So that's their great secret. Come on! Timmy, how many times have I told you not to chase rabbits? It doesn't feel dangerous when I tell you something. Would a good dog do that? You're a bad one. Come on now! Do I have to tell you everything a thousand times? Hello, George. Dick. So this is Timmy. How do you know his name? You just called him. He gave us a big fright. He's really sweet, George. Is he yours? Yes. And why haven't we seen him in the house yet? Father has forbidden me to keep him, but a boy in the village looks after him for me. I'd rather starve than give him away. And besides, I'm keeping him. him either. Oh, now I get it. So that's why you run away so much. But you don't need to be afraid. We won't tell you your secret. Absolutely not, George. Does he promise me that? Yes, we promise. You like us just as much as you do. Yes. Friends? Friends. I didn't like the fact that we were enemies anyway. What I wanted to tell you, George, is that the tunnel we found is not a normal tunnel. We didn't get very far, but we found some steps. Yes, they lead straight into the ground. And in the direction of Tumir. you're coming out with of course come on hello kids but it's now with my invitation we'd better go before he asks us what we're looking for down here yes I'm hungry anyway okay we're coming make yourselves comfortable then sit down guilty that's a bit messy Look at the telescope. Oh yes, that's my hobby. I watch birds. Karen Island. Oh, I can see Uncle Quentin's tower quite clearly. A kind of raven. Pyrocorax. Rare shorebirds. I've spotted a few of them on the island. Well, and of course I've seen you too. So, how's your father? My father? Oh yes. He's almost ready, he said. Oh, is that him? Yes. Good old Quentin. Er, well. Perhaps you could help me set the table. Some cake and biscuits. are in there I'm not doing the t up there now you'll find everything in the bottom compartment my boy excuse me oh my goodness the aunt I mean my aunt aunt john she's coming for tea have you forgotten you surely know her like that yes of course yes the days are really lovely unfortunately soon gone I'm sorry goodbye and thank you very much Well, but... It was really stupid of us. I'm sorry. Thank you anyway. Goodbye. Well, maybe another time. Who's Aunt Joan? We don't have an Aunt Joan at all. Of course not, but he said he knew her anyway. He's only pretending to be a friend of Father's. But I've never seen the guy before. You shouldn't have told him Father was nearly finished. You know it's a secret. I'm sorry, George. I didn't think of that. Don't you think you're exaggerating a bit, George? No, not at all. I think she's right. You probably didn't see what was in the closet. There was a radio, a pretty big one. Oh man! Really excellent, Kirk. Well, I'm sorry. You left so suddenly. I couldn't ask any questions. I heard everything I wanted to know. So Professor Kirin is, as the boy said, almost finished. Don't be so dogged, Kirk. You've got a lot to do tonight. Yes, maybe. But I still think we're worrying too much. As long as Uncle Quentin still signals on time. It's almost half past ten. Wow, that plane is flying low. It's flying over the island. Have you seen his signal yet, children? No, not yet. It should be coming any minute. Come on, father, go. Go! There! One, two, three. It's all right, George. Nothing's wrong. It's all right, Aunt Fanny. Good. Now off to bed with you. March, march. Phew, that's a relief. But first thing in the morning I'll look at the tower with binoculars. Good night. Good night. Night. Night. Professor Kirin, I presume. Who the hell are you? I don't think you know me. My name is Johnson. I'm from the Research Department. Thank God, Mr. Johnson. At first I thought you were some kind of... Or should I say, I was from the Research Department. Because recently... I have decided to open my own ministry. Do you understand? And this is the beginning, Professor. The best one I can think of. Here on Kirin Island. no danger. Trust in us, we'll get to work, who can resist us? Five friends, that's us. Julian, Dick and Ed, George and Tim, like the dog. Five friends, that's us. We'll come quickly, whenever you want us to. We're coming quickly And we're already here We're here"

If she gives this information to the police, it won't take them very long to figure out that Kira is actually me. I have no choice but to eliminate her. Something wrong? Oh, it's nothing. But the more I think about it...  The more your theory makes sense to me. We can't waste any time. We need to start investigating it right away. What? Really? Do you mean that? Yes. So, have you told anyone else about this? No. You're the first person I've told. You're lucky. But how will you get rid of her? It's not like you can do it here. Well, you have a gift for stating the obvious, Rick. Aren't you bold? Let's get started. Could you please tell me the date and time of your...  of the bus jacking incident? It was December 20th in front of Asagao Hill at 11.02 a.m., bound for Spaceland. December 20th, and they were on their way to Spaceland. Yes. This way, no one will find her body. And even if they do, they'll just assume that she's dead.  The death of her fianc\u00e9 drove her to commit suicide. What's so funny, Ryuki? I apologize for questioning all of you like that, but I'm afraid I had no other choice. I've determined that Kira is not among us. Ryuzaki, how can you be certain that we're all innocent? Well, to be honest, from the beginning I set a number of traps that  would reveal if any of you was Kira. But after speaking with you one-on-one, I don't feel the need. Excuse me? Unbelievable. He tells us to turn off our cell phones. Understood. I'm just about finished here anyway. You've got the key, so let yourself in. Watari's on his way. Uh-huh. So that's everything. I'd like to report this to the police.  incident to my father if it's okay with you that is well if it's all the same I think I'd like to report it myself and after talking to you I've decided that it would be best to do it as soon as possible that makes sense just 10 seconds until 1 15 I have to admit I'd really love to see how she dies but I can't be caught following her around go on  Hurry to your death. Kida will definitely be caught. Don't you think? Uh-huh. What's going on? It should have happened already.  This doesn't make sense. I don't understand why she's not leaving. I've had no problems making people kill themselves in the past. All I had to do was write the word suicide. The criminals I tested it on all hung themselves exactly when I specified. My experiments indicate that in a situation like this, I should be able to control a person's actions. So, what's wrong? Rick...  He laughed just like that when I was writing in the death note. And that's not all. I remember thinking it was bizarre how he laughed when I asked for her name. In fact, he's reacted the same way every time her name comes up. An alias? Gentlemen, it's an honor to meet all of you. This person is Watari?  Um, what about your usual outfit? If I dressed like that, I'd be announcing to the world that I am Watari. That's all it takes to give away the location of our headquarters in Ryuzaki. Oh, I see. Ordinarily, I would never show my face to any of you. The fact that I'm here is proof that you've won Ryuzaki's trust. Now that you mention it, I do feel honored. Well then, I brought those items you requested. It's all here. Could you please pass them out to everyone? Yes.  Yes. Gentlemen, these are your new police IDs. But what for? She used an alias. That has to be it. Ryuk knew all along. He could see her real name with his eyes. That's why he wouldn't stop laughing. I should have known. She's been overly cautious from the beginning. I see. It makes a lot of sense. She believes that Ray died because he showed his ID to Kira. So of course she did.  be careful not to reveal her own identity. Oh, this isn't good. It's gonna be almost impossible to ask for her real name knowing she gave me an alias the first time. If I'm too persistent, she'll get suspicious. What am I saying? It looks suspicious that I even knew she was using an alias. I should probably be getting back soon. Someone from the task force might be back there by now. Oh, yeah. You could be right. Let's cross our fingers and hope someone's there.  Yeah. Damn it. I'm running out of options here. I have to stop this before it's too late. Oh no. What if my father calls back now? I already promised her that I'd let her talk to him if he did. If this phone rings, it's all over for me. What am I going to do? This is crazy. All I have to do is turn it off.  my cell phone off. Problem solved. Now, calm down. You know what needs to be done. Just find out her real name. Her purse. Her pockets. She's got to have a driver's license or some kind of personal identification on her somewhere. She's a woman, after all. I suppose if I had to, I could use force. No. No, the last thing I want to do is make a scene in public. I've got to get her somewhere isolated. But where? And what explanation could I give her? I would never  work. She's too careful. I need a better approach. I can do this. I'm going to convince her to give me her real name. Hey, Light, you know, that deal I mentioned is still open. It's just like putting on contact lenses. Completely painless. Would I be willing to give up half my life just so I could learn this woman's real name? No, I wouldn't. In fact, it's not even worth considering. Now, quit wasting my time.  Just shut your mouth, Shinigami! Excuse me. Yes? Do you still have business at the police station, then? I'd like to go there by myself, if you don't mind. Yeah, no problem. Our names and ranks are false. Why did you give us fake IDs? As you know, Kira requires a name and a face to kill. We will confront him with that premise in mind, and I think it should be obvious why. Yes, but of all people that...  the police shouldn't use fake IDs. Enough. What choice do we really have given the capabilities of our enemy? As long as you're working on this case, I think we're going to need all the protection one can get. It would be foolish not to use them. Yeah, you got a good point. Uh-huh. Remember, anytime you're in a situation where you have to give out your name to a stranger, make sure to use the name from your fake ID, understood? Right. And be careful not to take them out while in the presence of other police officers. I'm sure I don't need to tell you. That could cause problems for us.  I understand. Very well, then. I'd like to request that you wear these at all times. Uh, belts? Each one has a transmitter hidden in the buckle. This will allow Ryozaki to monitor your whereabouts. And when you press the buckle twice like this, my cell phone will ring, displaying your name. And I'll call you back immediately, but you won't see my number displayed. In the morning, all of you will go to the police station as you speak.  usual then later on in the day we'll use this method to confirm the name of Ryuzaki's hotel and his room number please use this for emergencies as well no way this is totally cool I feel like some kind of secret agent going after Kira quiet Matsuda this is not the time to be fooling around knock it off yes sir thank you so much for everything you've done light after talking to you I feel much more confident about my theory not at all  Considering that Ryuk mentioned that ideal again, there's no doubt in my mind that she used an alias. At this rate, once she goes to the police with her theory about Kira being on that bus, and they look at all the people Ray Pembro was investigating, it won't take them long to zero in on me. Hey, she's leaving. So now what? I've got about five minutes before that woman gets to police headquarters.  headquarters. Think, I need her real name, and I don't have much time to spare. If this woman makes it to the police station and someone from the task force has returned by then, it'll all be over for me. I've got to find out her real name, then eliminate her quickly. Only three minutes.  until she reaches the station. Alright. Uh-oh. Whatcha doin'? Excuse me. Yes? There's something that I should probably tell you. Okay. The thing is, it'll be impossible for you to contact anyone from the task force directly. Huh? That's right. Keep the conversation going. I just need to find something that she can latch onto, and I've got her. When she's comfortable, then I can get her real name. I can do that.  I can't contact anyone, but why not? Didn't you find it odd that there was no one at Task Force Headquarters? Uh, yeah. I did find it a bit strange, but I didn't... Let me explain. The Task Force has been organized so that its members can't be identified and nobody on the outside knows who's in charge. If the members' names were ever made public, or the structure of the Task Force was revealed, we'd likely see another tragedy along the lines of the one that claimed your fianc\u00e9's life.  I see. That's why you were told earlier that no one was at Task Force headquarters. What I'm trying to say is, you'll never be able to talk to someone directly from the Task Force because the police simply won't allow it. That's pretty clever. I'm impressed. If this is supposed to be a secret, then how do you know so much? Guess I spoke too soon, She's Sharp.  Very well. You leave me no choice. It's because I'm actually a member of the task force. I'm sorry, you're telling me that you're an agent? Yes. L is currently in charge of the task force, and he's leading our investigation. Yes. To be honest, I already suspected that. He was concerned that the task force had become too small. Many detectives had quit fearing for their lives, and so... Despite the fact that I'm a high school student, he brought me on board to help out with the investigation.  After all, I've helped them solve cases in the past. So, L trusts you, then? I can go to task force headquarters whenever it suits me, and I'm allowed to investigate freely as I see fit. You see, these days the task force is made up of a chosen few, an elite group of people handpicked for the job by L. All are highly skilled, well-respected, and above all, trustworthy.  Thanks for explaining, but just to be safe, I'd like to try and visit the task force headquarters again. Uh-huh. Goodbye. Bye. Please, wait a second. It's like I just told you, they won't let you talk to anyone. I know, but I was hoping I could speak with Elle directly. Goodbye. Oh, and come to think of it, who...  Who's at the police station right now? Actually, no one's there at the moment. That's not good news. We need someone there at all times. Work in shifts if you have to. I understand. Aizawa, I'll put you in charge of that for today. Yes, sir. I'm on my way. Won't take me long. Ms. Maki, please, wait a second. It's literally impossible to meet L. This is pointless. You may be right, but I think that there's a chance that he'll meet with me. Uh-huh.  Although the only contact I've had with him was following orders through a computer, he might remember who I am. You see, I worked under him in a case in the U.S. about two years ago. Are you serious? You worked under L? Yes. I didn't tell you this, but up until three months ago, I worked as an FBI agent. This is it. Finally something I can use. Guess I shouldn't be surprised. In fact, I noticed early on that your investigative skills were far beyond those of an amateur. You're right.  You're very cautious, and you seem to have a gift for getting to the heart of the matter. If I could, I'd like to learn from you. One lie after another, you make it look easy. From the beginning, I knew I had to do things outside the regular channels, because from my perspective, both the police and the members of the task force were suspects. But I'm certain that I can trust Elle. Maybe it's unrealistic, but I think that if I go to headquarters and I give them my name, there's a chance that they'll let me speak with him.  directly. I see. But if the only person you could trust with this info was L, then why me? I suppose I was upset that they wouldn't allow me to see anyone from the task force, and then you came along, claiming to be the son of the lead detective, and... No, that's not it. I'll be honest with you. It's because you remind me of L. There's something about you that's just like him. Hmm.  Will you investigate this case with me? Huh? I want you to come work with us as part of the task force. We could use your help. As I'm sure you know, not just anyone can do it. Please. I know this is sudden, but the team needs people like you. I'm serious. You could be doing so much more than gathering information on your own. You have all the experience as an FBI agent. You're more talented than most of the detectives currently...  on the task force and L obviously trusted you in the past. It wouldn't be that difficult for you to join. All you'd need is some valid identification, a recommendation from a current task force member, and of course you need to get L's permission. You want me to join the task force? I can't help but think that it must be fate that I met you today. I'd like to be the one to recommend you. Oh, I'm sorry about that. I guess I got a little bit too excited. It's okay.  I mean, even if you acted as a consultant on this investigation, it would be a great help. I'm sure you have personal obligations to attend to, not to mention the fact that you live in the United States. It's true. Before all this happened, I thought I'd continue living in America with my fianc\u00e9. We planned on getting married in the spring. But now he's gone, so I'm not sure what to do anymore. All right, I've come this far. All she needs is a little encouragement. But you're young and beautiful, and you've got your life ahead of you. Why put it all in danger for you?  for this no now that Ray's gone I've got nothing to lose anymore I want to catch Kira I don't care about anything else it's all I want to do please let me investigate this case with you yes of course I just need to see some form of identification before we proceed oh yes you see the name I gave you earlier well I  It wasn't actually my real name. I'm so sorry. Don't worry, it's all right. To be honest, I'm impressed by how incredibly thorough you've been. You've stayed one step ahead of me. But I suppose that's just further proof of your capabilities. So will a Japanese driver's license do the trick, then? Sure.  I made it in time. So, if you don't mind my asking, why do you  I keep checking your watch. Oh, well... I guess it's because... Because I'm Kira.  What's the matter? There's something I have to do. My father's cell phone might be available now. Do you want to see if you can talk to him? No, thank you. I have nothing to say to him.

        "translated": "In the spreading darkness, the trees of the trees exchange their eyes. I can't let anyone get in my way. The quest tells me sameme ... Next Episode Regardless of how she came to the conclusion, the fact remains this woman knows the truth. If she gives this information to the police, it won't take them very long to figure out that Kira is actually me. I have no choice but to eliminate her. Something wrong? Oh, it's nothing. But the more I think about it... The more your theory makes sense to me. We can't waste any time. We need to start investigating it right away. What? Really? Do you mean that? Yes. So, have you told anyone else about this? No. You're the first person I've told. You're lucky. But how will you get rid of her? It's not like you can do it here. Well, you have a gift for stating the obvious, Rick. Aren't you bold? Let's get started. Could you please tell me the date and time of your... of the bus jacking incident? It was December 20th in front of Asagao Hill at 11.02 a.m., bound for Spaceland. December 20th, and they were on their way to Spaceland. Yes. This way, no one will find her body. And even if they do, they'll just assume that she's dead. The death of her fianc\u00e9 drove her to commit suicide. What's so funny, Ryuki? I apologize for questioning all of you like that, but I'm afraid I had no other choice. I've determined that Kira is not among us. Ryuzaki, how can you be certain that we're all innocent? Well, to be honest, from the beginning I set a number of traps that would reveal if any of you was Kira. But after speaking with you one-on-one, I don't feel the need. Excuse me? Unbelievable. He tells us to turn off our cell phones. Understood. I'm just about finished here anyway. You've got the key, so let yourself in. Watari's on his way. Uh-huh. So that's everything. I'd like to report this to the police. incident to my father if it's okay with you that is well if it's all the same I think I'd like to report it myself and after talking to you I've decided that it would be best to do it as soon as possible that makes sense just 10 seconds until 1 15 I have to admit I'd really love to see how she dies but I can't be caught following her around go on Hurry to your death. Kida will definitely be caught. Don't you think? Uh-huh. What's going on? It should have happened already. This doesn't make sense. I don't understand why she's not leaving. I've had no problems making people kill themselves in the past. All I had to do was write the word suicide. The criminals I tested it on all hung themselves exactly when I specified. My experiments indicate that in a situation like this, I should be able to control a person's actions. So, what's wrong? Rick... He laughed just like that when I was writing in the death note. And that's not all. I remember thinking it was bizarre how he laughed when I asked for her name. In fact, he's reacted the same way every time her name comes up. An alias? Gentlemen, it's an honor to meet all of you. This person is Watari? Um, what about your usual outfit? If I dressed like that, I'd be announcing to the world that I am Watari. That's all it takes to give away the location of our headquarters in Ryuzaki. Oh, I see. Ordinarily, I would never show my face to any of you. The fact that I'm here is proof that you've won Ryuzaki's trust. Now that you mention it, I do feel honored. Well then, I brought those items you requested. It's all here. Could you please pass them out to everyone? Yes. Yes. Gentlemen, these are your new police IDs. But what for? She used an alias. That has to be it. Ryuk knew all along. He could see her real name with his eyes. That's why he wouldn't stop laughing. I should have known. She's been overly cautious from the beginning. I see. It makes a lot of sense. She believes that Ray died because he showed his ID to Kira. So of course she did. be careful not to reveal her own identity. Oh, this isn't good. It's gonna be almost impossible to ask for her real name knowing she gave me an alias the first time. If I'm too persistent, she'll get suspicious. What am I saying? It looks suspicious that I even knew she was using an alias. I should probably be getting back soon. Someone from the task force might be back there by now. Oh, yeah. You could be right. Let's cross our fingers and hope someone's there. Yeah. Damn it. I'm running out of options here. I have to stop this before it's too late. Oh no. What if my father calls back now? I already promised her that I'd let her talk to him if he did. If this phone rings, it's all over for me. What am I going to do? This is crazy. All I have to do is turn it off. my cell phone off.

She's got to have a driver's license or some kind of personal identification on her somewhere. She's a woman, after all. I suppose if I had to, I could use force. No. No, the last thing I want to do is make a scene in public. I've got to get her somewhere isolated. But where? And what explanation could I give her? I would never work. She's too careful. I need a better approach. I can do this. I'm going to convince her to give me her real name. Hey, Light, you know, that deal I mentioned is still open. It's just like putting on contact lenses. Completely painless. Would I be willing to give up half my life just so I could learn this woman's real name? No, I wouldn't. In fact, it's not even worth considering. Now, quit wasting my time. Just shut your mouth, Shinigami! Excuse me. Yes? Do you still have business at the police station, then? I'd like to go there by myself, if you don't mind. Yeah, no problem.

We don't need that. Take her statement, get her signature, and it is a done deal. Oh, just like that. Meanwhile, I heard that a bent warrant went out on Billy Lucas two weeks ago. Federal case. Mixed bag of charges. Counterfeiting to attempted murder. What's her role?  this where does she fit in what's her background well she's not talking until the lawyer shows up but all we got on her right now is that she's from north carolina she's got three priors for b and e and a gun charge and does she do any time no they would drop all right well you see where we might have some blanks to fill in here gentlemen so why don't we do that and then we can wrap it up all right yeah uh well well well what do we got here i'm miles jordan mcgrath was new york attorney she's ready to cooperate fully  Okay, I'll bite first. New York attorney. What, you got one in every state now? Not yet, but if business picks up, I'll need more. What is this business that you do? Fugitive retrieval. That almost sounds professional, huh? But let's be real, you're nothing but a damn bounty hunter. When the bell jumper turned nasty, I had to take him down. It was him or me. Do I have stupid written on my face? You expect me to buy that? No, you just don't like it. Well, that too. You see, you bounty hunters...  are not professionals. You don't even know what the hell you're doing out there. You're out of line, detective. My client came into town yesterday. She had certified copies of the bail agreement. She came in and she checked in with the desk sergeant downstairs. She went by the book. There is no book. That is the problem. So what really happened, Erica? He spooked you and then what? Boom, you had to shoot him? Is that what happened? I don't spook easily and I don't get paid on corpses. Look, he took my gun, he had me on the ground, he was going to fire. I had no choice. Right, right. So how would you...  you able to track him down so fast? Criminals are creatures of habit. Lucas had a thing for a hooker, so I just passed some cash around and waited for a nibble. So who ratted him out? Some washed out skank on Times Square. She must have sold me out because a clown knew I was coming. What's her name? Crystal. Crystal what? Chandelier. How the hell am I supposed to know? She's a hooker. For a price, she'd be any name you wanted her to be. Enough, Lennon. You make a decision. If you charge my client, we'll cut her loose.  Lieutenant. Yeah, well, that's it, gentlemen. Check the desk, Sergeant, and see if her story holds up. Lieutenant. No, what, Williams? Whether you like it or not, bounty hunting's a legal occupation. They are dangerous amateurs, Lieutenant. What about the people's rights? Futurists don't have any rights. They hand them over to the bail bondsman, who in turn gives it to the bounty hunter. Look, a man is dead. Now, he may have been a criminal, but she's the one that took his life. Yes, which only goes to support the argument that things went wrong.  bad towards the end, Suarez. Now, she had a lot to gain by bringing Lucas in alive. That's a hell of a way to make a living. What do we do now? Well, we make sure that CSU and the coroner agree on trajectory load and buckshot spray. We cross every T dot every I. Sorry I'm late. Don't sweat it, you cubs. Cooper asked for me? She did indeed. Well, what'd you tell her? Female problems. What? Cubs is a myriad of ills. This way nobody asked me, Jack. So where were you anyway? My attorneys.  anything wrong who's catching your turn i got the last marino fourth squad yep okay you'll be right there i got a shooting tommy it's a cop it's like a service all right  Any of you not here as part of the investigation, leave now. You're destroying the crime scene. Look, how about I take the body? Sure. Officer Donahue? Yeah. You need a few minutes or can we do this in... No, no, look, the quicker the better. Now, how soon before the wagon gets here? I don't want Vincent's wife seeing him like this. It should be here soon. So what happened? We worked a late tour. I drop him off as usual. I go home to crash. Camille, that's his wife. She calls me from her job. She's hysterical and in a panic. What about? She says they're talking on the phone and, uh...  Suddenly he yells at somebody, and then the phone went dead. She kept calling back, but there was no answer. So that's when you came over to check it out? Yeah, right, and I get here, and, uh... Take your time. Uh, the door was open, and, uh, the mess and everything, and... Yes, it was, uh... Um, single shot to the head, close range. There was powder burns around the wound. I checked his pulse. I used my cell.  to call it in. Nothing's been touched. Was there anything missing? His gun. I don't know what else. You're gonna have to ask Camille. Hey, Matt. Yeah, what you got? Camille, take a look. Okay, Wyler, I need pictures. All angles. Right here. Hey. Hello. And hello to you, too. Have a seat. You're looking good, girl. Thank you. Is this what you need? Yeah. I'm always leaving those somewhere.  Yo, my man, I hate to say this, but it looks like old girl was right. Really? Yeah. Ah, Natasha, this is my partner, Eddie Torres. Hi. This is G's French teacher. Uh-huh. Right. Uh, you know what? I gotta fuck, right? Nice to meet you. My man. Joe, anyway, um... I'm out of here, Williams. What'd you do? Me? Nothing. Don't let him break you, honey. He'll be back on the street in no time.  Didn't they tell you that you can go? So why don't you go? I'm after Lucas's pal, Kevin Swain. Wanted you to know, just in case. Who was that? Some trouble. Well, I'm gonna let you get back to work, okay? All right, so listen. What we should do, right? What I think we should do, right, we should meet tonight, go have dinner, it's a nice place.  Hello, Alex. Will you come? I'm gonna see if they lock you up, Rock. Even if I have to do it myself. Nobody's called me that in a long time. You murdered Billy Lucas. Who, Benny? Listen, I'm warning you. Stay away from Kevin Swain. He's mine. Unless he's in shackles. He's up for grabs. No, not this time. We'll go way back, you and me. I don't want to see you get hurt. I touched him, really.  The thing about it is not to be trusted. These are two detectives working on the case. Alex Pratt, Deputy U.S. Marshal. How's it going? So what's this all about? Erica Rockler. The lieutenant was telling me that so far this looks clean. What are you saying, that it's not? I know it's not. Rock used to be one of us. She worked for the government. She was a marshal. And a good one, too. Until she lost a witness in a Treasury case. The two men suspected of...  orchestrating that particular horror show, with Billy Lucas and Kevin Swain. So you think that it's revenge? Absolutely. She lost her witness and her career, not revenge. I'd say that's mild. Yes, sir. All righty, then. The feds say they're going to send over that file on Kevin Swain.  as soon as possible. Which means never. You got it. So BCI says the man's got 14 priors for forgery, bond instead of $2 million, and like Lucas, a warrant was issued two weeks ago. If Erica bags him, that's 200 Gs in her pocket. That's a big payday. She's got a score to settle with this Lucas guy. Yeah, but we don't have any evidence to support murder. Motive, Ed. She lied to us. All right, fine. Why don't we start with her snitch? Erica says that she set her up, so maybe she'll want to ask why. All right, we got a girl by the name of...  name of Crystal Wade, 110th and Pleasant. Where have you been? Ow! You're hurting me! Where's Lucas? We have a meet in two hours. I'm dead. What? How? Some bitch came sniffing around looking for both of you, so I called Lucas and told him about it. You said him? No, I didn't. I swear I didn't.  He told me to page her, get her to come to the club. I just did what he said. I swear I did. Who is she? Her name's Erica. The cops locked her up. Where are you going? Shut up. What about me? I'm going with you. No, you're not. Yes, I am. Don't make this hard a swing. You won't survive. Shoot and kill. Whatever.  It's you I need a lot. Hey, hold it! Back up! Drop it! Put it down. He's mine.  Mrs. Vincent. I'm sorry about your loss. Camille, these are the detectives that'll be working the case. They're gonna find a bastard. Now, you were on the phone when this happened, is that right? He always called me when he worked nights. And let me know he was on the phone.  All right. And what did you hear? A crash. Like something broke. Then Todd yelled and the phone went dead. Do you remember what he yelled? Hey. That's it? Was your husband suffering from depression? What difference does that make? I'm just covering all the bases, Donahue. You should know that. Ma'am, was he having problems on the job? No. My husband was not unhappy, and he was not...  crazy. Someone killed him or don't you care? Nice technique, detectives. It's a hell of a way to treat one of your own. You went for the books, kid. How's that? Bench warrant bonded for two mil. Uncle Sam must want you bad. I want to make a call. I'm entitled to a call. That's my right. Sure, no problem. I mean, as soon as we process.  just these other charges. Murder, fake money. I mean, that pretty much guarantees you life. What do you want? Where'd you get the money? What do I get? Oh, the mercy of the court and a smile on my face. Sweeten the deal. I'll lead you right to him. Meets in an hour, Riverside Underpass. Me with who? Deal first. No, you're in no position to bargain, baby. Well, maybe you should look at these C-notes again, baby. They're supposed to be counterfeiting.  It's counterfeit proof. Tell you what, why don't you call the feds? I bet they make a deal. We'll see. So, Lieutenant, you think we can swing this? It's worth a shot. I'm gonna talk to the state's attorney and see what we have to offer. Don't do this, Lieutenant. It's a mistake. You can't play federal games with local talent. Your opinion doesn't count. And I'm doing you a favor by even allowing you in here, Ms. Rockler. Lieutenant, please, let me in.  Let me take him in. Justice can sort out the rest. What you really want? You pal Pratt and the feds tell a difference. I knew Alex Pratt would fill you in. He used you. Really? How? By getting me out of the way. See, my motive is strictly money. His is prestige. He brings Swain in first. Hell, even Jana Reno would have to take notice. Let me take him in. I have to surrender him to the sheriff to collect my fee. Sorry, this is going to go down our way. Set it up, Williams. Yes, ma'am.  Listen, Erica... It's okay, Williams. I already know how to bend over. Can you hear me?  How's it going, Bates? I heard your legal battle has escalated. Yeah, that's why I'm here. My buyer's real interested in your plates. Of course. Come on, you're not gonna try to jack the price up on me, are you? Kevin, the free market is not for neophytes. I mean, you're in trouble. You need this deal.  I don't. Unless Bates says something concrete, he's gonna walk. Yeah, but you know he's gonna be careful. I gotta get out of town. I'll let you know. Company. Damn, he made us. Let's go. The terrorists.  What the hell is she doing here? What the hell are you doing? Getting my money. Let's go. Move it now, Kate. Do not shoot. Herb is unarmed. Go. Go. Come on. Come on. U.S. forces. Back off, Bill. This is a federal matter. It's Swain in the band. He is a protected witness. Back off.  What the hell are you doing? My job. Get inside. Get inside, Cal. What's going on? Hey, you! Two years' work down the drain because your detectives couldn't master Surveillance 101. Watch how you talk about my men, Pratt, all right? And you're in no position to throw stones because you didn't even tell me that there was a federal operation going on in my jurisdiction. It wasn't my call. I protect the witness. That's it. You're a son of a bitch, Alex.  Kenneth Swain murdered a witness under our protection, and you gave that lowlife snitch a deal. You have no evidence to prove that, and frankly, Rock, if you remember, there is nothing more important than the national interest. You already lost your store over this. Let it go. I need some air. Oh, yeah. Look, I don't like this any more than you do, but the fact is, we need bait to get Russell Bates. That money hits the streets, we won't recover for years. Yeah, right.  So you're saying this promotion that you get for bringing him in is just gravy, right? Spare me the soapbox, detective. You're willing to make a deal with Swain to get it baked yourself. I was ready to send him to jail, not to some beach with a new idea and a pocket full of money. Most criminals who enter the program do time first. He's not going to do a day in time if it's up to you. I mean, besides, we've got solid proof against your boy for murder. A man can't stand trial if he no longer exists. Lou, come on. Oh, please, let it go, Torres. We should have processed him while we had him. Possessions, $9.  to the law. Hey, Matt. The, um, paraffin test on Officer Vincent came back inconclusive. CSU said there were too many astringent chemicals present. Like what? Bleach would do it. Industrial strength cleaners. Suspicious enough that his hands were washed. Yeah, well, not if he just came out of the shower and was washing dishes. Yeah, right. Thanks. Thank you. Let's get out of here, huh?  Is Detective Williams here? He'll be down in a sec. Park it. So, what'd you do this time? Gave a damn. I knew the system wasn't perfect, but I thought it worked. You're a cop? Not anymore. I don't want to end up a drunk or playing with my gun in the dark.  Sorry. Don't waste that on me. You save that for the poor slobs like Williams. They need your pity. I haven't known J.C. very long, but he does not seem like the kind of man anyone should feel sorry for. Not yet, but it's coming. He's got that cop disease. Look, I don't know what you're talking about, but if J.C. wants to tell me something, I'd prefer he told me on his own. Then you're in for a long wait. You see, cops don't talk to anybody else but cops. Wives and girlfriends, they don't know Jack until they...  come home and there's brains splattered all over the wall. You're exaggerating. Why is that? Look, the job comes first. Canceled dates, unanswered questions, mood swings, and if you have kids with cops, you can count on raising them your own damn self. There's one thing I know about JC, is that he takes a big part in raising his son. Well, have you ever talked to the boy's mother? I'm sure she might sing a different tune. You obviously don't know.  I know them better than you do, and I just met them. Give J.C. a message for me. Tell him not to let it get to him. Not let what get to him? If he wants you to know, he'll tell you.  Something wrong? Hey, yeah, um, I'm sorry. I meant to call you, I just... That's okay, don't worry about it. What happened? Just this case I'm working on, you know, the whole thing went bust. It's leaving a bad taste in my mouth. Well, I'm a good listener if you want somebody to talk to. Oh, thanks. Okay, well, uh, call me later? Will do. Oh, yeah, that...  Um, that girl that was here earlier... Who, Erica? Yeah. She told me to tell you, don't let it get to you. She said that, huh? Yeah, she's wanting to talk. Did she say where she was going? Sorry. I'll see you later. Listen, I just want you to know I really did want to see you tonight. Yeah, me too. All right.  Measure for measure Your love's so much pleasure Like a haunted melody You came inside and you captured me So, how do you want to handle this, Tommy? We've got to close this case on soon. Well, it's a suicide. Donnie, who tried to cover for his partner, took his gun from the scene.  If we go for Warren, every cop on the squad is gonna be out by blood. He'd be stupid to keep it anyway. The wife. The wife's the weak link. We get her alone, it's over. We sure we want to do this. It means donning his career. And his wife's pension. I don't know what I'm supposed to think or feel. Well, I know this. Just because he pulled the trigger doesn't mean the job didn't kill him. I don't know.  You know how to love me. I'm alright. I'm fresh away. You know how to love me. Tonight, when I want to sing. You know how to love me.  May I help you? You and I? Yeah. Come in. So, um... I thought you were going to North Carolina. I don't like the country. So? So why do you live there, then? It's cheap. Cheap like what? What are you looking for, Williams? You have no business poking around in my fire! Pratt gave this to me.  okay what does he have against you anyway I was his partner and I never told him that our witness had contact with the relative I lost my job and Alex lost a promotion so is that the reason why your witness was killed oh yeah he loved his wife and they knew it she refused to go into the program you can't see  that a blamer all you get for your civic duty is a new birth certificate and twelve hundred dollars a month for a year and a half so why did he come forward because he was a damn fool who didn't know you witness a murder you mind your own business you don't make a description you don't finger the bastards and line up you don't give up your life because it's the right thing to do okay  Come on. It's okay. Come here. Don't be nice to me, Will. No, come here. You don't need to cry, all right? It's gonna be fine. All right? Okay? Okay?  What's it gonna be? I can't pretend Don't you wanna be Holdin' fresh All night and don't let go Don't let go You have me to get Don't let go I didn't tell you  I know you think that we move too soon, it would all end. I live in misery when you're not around. And I won't be standing still till the chicken's all found. There'll be some love making, heart breaking, soul shaking. Oh, love making.  Heartbreaking, soul shaking What you gonna be? Cause I can't pretend Don't you wanna be Don't you wanna be A woman's friend Hold me tight and don't let go Don't let go I have the right to lose You got the right You got the right I said you got the right to lose Woo!  Country roads, yeah, yeah. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Don't let go. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. What's up, young? What's up? Sweeney and two deputy marshals were ambushed. Pratt's on my ass, and the feds are trying to take over my precinct. Other than that, Williams, it's quiet. Wait, did you see him?  When? Around 11 o'clock last night. A woman matching Erica's description was seen at the hotel. I want an all-point out on her, and I want this mess cleared up before the brass door call on me. No, it wasn't her. Williams, I know how you feel. She's been through it and then some, but now it's out of my hands. No, Lieutenant, I know that it wasn't her, because she was with me last night. She was with you? Yeah, she was with me. Where is she now?  She's at a hotel. He'll get her to us. What's the problem? What? What? I told you everything that I know. He yelled, hey, and we got that. Now, there wasn't much missing from your place. Maybe they got scared when they shot my husband. Why was Officer Vincent seeing a police rank?  I thought that was confidential. It is. That's why I'm asking. I don't know. You didn't ask? He said it was for the job. For the job or because of it. See, cops lose it all the time. Need to get it off their chest. We cheat on our spouses. We drink. Even eat our guns. We got a saying around the squad. If you can get two shots off before the end, you're a real hard ass. See?  He didn't kill himself. Then how did he get powder burns on his hand? We have a test for that, Camille. We checked his reports. He hadn't fired his weapon in weeks. And there was broken glass outside the window. If the perps broke in, the glass would have been on the floor. We're not stupid. He said you wouldn't know.  What time did you leave the precinct? After everything that's happened. You can't believe that I did this. Well, you didn't pull the trigger because Detective Williams said you were together. Then why am I here? Because you went to the Regent Hotel. See, Swain was being held there before being moved to a safe house, and somehow, you're pretty the last found out. I wasn't there. Yes, you were, because somebody ID'd your photo. If I was with Williams, how do you explain it?  Revenge? Change the record. This one's a little tired. You know, you're not the only one with a grudge, Erica. As of yesterday, Russell Bates... Williams, get back here. Prove it. Oh, I will. And I can't... Man, I got this. I got it. I guess I know how you feel, huh? Betrayed. Used. Then you get angry, right?  And payback is the only thing that you can think about until she becomes a bitch all of a sudden. That's about right, isn't it? I mean, you played me well, girl. I mean, who else better to vouch for you than a cop? It wasn't like that. But this time I'm going to play you, all right? Now, you're right. We can't prove it. You're going to have to cooperate. And trust me when I tell you, you will when I'm done with you. I'm out of here. You sit your ass right here. Are you?  went to Bates, you told him where to find Swain. You told him how the marshals operate. He ends up dead. So whether or not you gave it to him for free or you sold it to him, you did it, we know it, and you're going to pay for that. How, Williams? I'm going to go to Bates, just like you did. And I'm going to tell him we got you on two counts of conspiracy to murder U.S. Deputy Marshals and one Kevin Swain. Then I'm going to tell him it's just a matter of time before you serve him up to us on the planet.  Who think you're posturing? I will, Willie. And you're willing to take that risk. I don't believe you. It's not your style.  All right. Good. The meat's set. Remember, bait's no joke. You just better make sure you cover my ass. You're a protected witness, whether I like it or not. I told you before, we'll do anything to get baits, even give you a deal. Listen, the purse is wired in the lining. The pager is the backup. Now, the range isn't good on either one, so...  We're gonna have to be close. Just get Bates to say something incriminating, and then we'll come in. I know what you mean. Williams. Can I have a minute? I'm never meant to hurt you. I just couldn't let Swain get away again. Let me ask you something. If you get away with doing the same thing, then what makes you feel better?  What makes you different than him? Look, I couldn't take the national interest anymore. The snitches and the finks, double-dipping between federal agencies. We spent over $100 million on snitches last year. Swain was the last straw. That's very noble, Erica. Why don't you write a book? Huh. The reason why I chose you is because I knew you wouldn't leave me twisting in the wind. I knew you were a good cop.  their mouths about us. It's not my morals that I question. It's just my taste. Move your hands a little to the left. I might get something out of this too.  She's clean. For a woman, you travel very light. Makeup's in the car. You want it? Some men appreciate a sharp wit in a female. I'm not one of them. When we talked yesterday, you didn't seem to mind. I don't know what you're talking about. I gave you a freebie. You said butchers instead of somebody subtle. Sure.  So get to the point. I got cops asking me questions. I don't like it. Slippery son of a bitch. He hasn't said a damn thing we can use. I could give you a loan to help you straighten out your problems. Fortunately, don't keep any cash in your pocket. Come on, do something, Rock. How much we talking here? I gave you Swain's whereabouts. Two marshals got killed. How much you need? Enough to get lost.  fair enough go with my associate he'll take care of you what the hell is she doing you're proud your witness is leaving she left one of the transmitters in the office we have to stay in range so where are we going anyway so  You know what? I know this city like the back of my hand. If you take Houston, you're gonna hit traffic, so maybe we should turn up this street a bit. Now, which street did she say, man? I've lost her, really. I'm static. Okay, I got a little belt. Don't worry about it.  Yes, sir, I understand. Okay. Uh, don't take this personally. I don't like people sitting behind me. If you could just move over, I'd appreciate it. Yeah, sure. Where is she? Come on, is there anything coming through, yeah? Nothing.  There they are. All units, suspect sight. Alley behind the mountain, chambers. Out of the car! Let's go, let's go! Where is she? Get up! Where is she? Out of the car, will you? Hey, fuck! There we are.  What the hell is she? He hear me talking to you? Say, see. Move, Edmund.  You're done now. Sit down, Don, if you... Unless you want to tell your story to one police plaza. What difference does it make who I talk to? If the girls don't report that you staged this whole thing, the brass won't be satisfied with just your resignation.  Did Officer Vincent take his own life? Maybe you forgot what it's like out there on the street. And hell, you gold shields don't show up till the smoke's cleared anyway. We still got our shaft. Believe me. You don't see some guy beating the crap out of his wife. Or watch some kid blow her brains out, and you never find out why. So he eats his own life.  gun and leads you to clean up his mess he was my partner what's this officer Todd Vincent died from a gunshot wound fired by an unknown assailant  Hey, bonjour.

Yeah, um, you know that woman who was working on that case? Yeah, Erica. Well, she was killed. JC, I'm so sorry. Yeah, me too. So I needed to, you know, just take time away. I know we didn't get off to the best start, so what I want to try to do is make it up to you. I don't think that'd be a good idea. Why not?  JC, I don't always know what I want, but I know what I don't want. What, Jess? Second place. Not over a woman, not over a job, nothing. Who's talking about second place? And then, you know, people settle. And that's not me. So... Prince?

Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You did. You left him in the truck. Sure, you can come down, pick it up anytime you need. No, that would be no trouble at all, baby. I'll see you then. Au revoir. Woo! Yo, Ed. She left her glasses in the truck, all right? She's gonna come to pick them up. What she left was a big, flat hand. Come on, man. What, are you slipping now or something? You don't get it? What, me? Lieutenant, we got our purpose. Her name is Erica Rockwell. She admitted to it, and we got the weapon. And? It's an easy close, Lou. I don't know, gentlemen. What about motive? Oh, come on. We don't need that. Take her statement, get her signature, and it is a done deal. Oh, just like that. Meanwhile, I heard that a bent warrant went out on Billy Lucas two weeks ago. Federal case. Mixed bag of charges. Counterfeiting to attempted murder. What's her role? this where does she fit in what's her background well she's not talking until the lawyer shows up but all we got on her right now is that she's from north carolina she's got three priors for b and e and a gun charge and does she do any time no they would drop all right well you see where we might have some blanks to fill in here gentlemen so why don't we do that and then we can wrap it up all right yeah uh well well well what do we got here i'm miles jordan mcgrath was new york attorney she's ready to cooperate fully Okay, I'll bite first. New York attorney. What, you got one in every state now? Not yet, but if business picks up, I'll need more. What is this business that you do? Fugitive retrieval. That almost sounds professional, huh? But let's be real, you're nothing but a damn bounty hunter. When the bell jumper turned nasty, I had to take him down. It was him or me. Do I have stupid written on my face? You expect me to buy that? No, you just don't like it. Well, that too. You see, you bounty hunters... are not professionals. You don't even know what the hell you're doing out there. You're out of line, detective. My client came into town yesterday. She had certified copies of the bail agreement. She came in and she checked in with the desk sergeant downstairs. She went by the book. There is no book. That is the problem. So what really happened, Erica? He spooked you and then what? Boom, you had to shoot him? Is that what happened? I don't spook easily and I don't get paid on corpses. Look, he took my gun, he had me on the ground, he was going to fire. I had no choice. Right, right. So how would you... you able to track him down so fast? Criminals are creatures of habit. Lucas had a thing for a hooker, so I just passed some cash around and waited for a nibble. So who ratted him out? Some washed out skank on Times Square. She must have sold me out because a clown knew I was coming. What's her name? Crystal. Crystal what? Chandelier. How the hell am I supposed to know? She's a hooker. For a price, she'd be any name you wanted her to be. Enough, Lennon. You make a decision. If you charge my client, we'll cut her loose. Lieutenant. Yeah, well, that's it, gentlemen. Check the desk, Sergeant, and see if her story holds up. Lieutenant. No, what, Williams? Whether you like it or not, bounty hunting's a legal occupation. They are dangerous amateurs, Lieutenant. What about the people's rights? Futurists don't have any rights. They hand them over to the bail bondsman, who in turn gives it to the bounty hunter. Look, a man is dead. Now, he may have been a criminal, but she's the one that took his life. Yes, which only goes to support the argument that things went wrong. bad towards the end, Suarez. Now, she had a lot to gain by bringing Lucas in alive. That's a hell of a way to make a living. What do we do now? Well, we make sure that CSU and the coroner agree on trajectory load and buckshot spray. We cross every T dot every I. Sorry I'm late. Don't sweat it, you cubs. Cooper asked for me? She did indeed. Well, what'd you tell her? Female problems. What? Cubs is a myriad of ills. This way nobody asked me, Jack. So where were you anyway? My attorneys. anything wrong who's catching your turn i got the last marino fourth squad yep okay you'll be right there i got a shooting tommy it's a cop it's like a service all right Any of you not here as part of the investigation, leave now. You're destroying the crime scene. Look, how about I take the body? Sure. Officer Donahue? Yeah. You need a few minutes or can we do this in... No, no, look, the quicker the better. Now, how soon before the wagon gets here? I don't want Vincent's wife seeing him like this. It should be here soon. So what happened? We worked a late tour. I drop him off as usual. I go home to crash. Camille, that's his wife. She calls me from her job. She's hysterical and in a panic. What about? She says they're talking on the phone and, uh... Suddenly he yells at somebody, and then the phone went dead. She kept calling back, but there was no answer. So that's when you came over to check it out? Yeah, right, and I get here, and, uh... Take your time. Uh, the door was open, and, uh, the mess and everything, and... Yes, it was, uh... Um, single shot to the head, close range. There was powder burns around the wound. I checked his pulse. I used my cell. to call it in. Nothing's been touched. Was there anything missing? His gun. I don't know what else. You're gonna have to ask Camille. Hey, Matt. Yeah, what you got? Camille, take a look. Okay, Wyler, I need pictures. All angles. Right here. Hey. Hello. And hello to you, too. Have a seat. You're looking good, girl. Thank you. Is this what you need? Yeah. I'm always leaving those somewhere. Yo, my man, I hate to say this, but it looks like old girl was right. Really? Yeah. Ah, Natasha, this is my partner, Eddie Torres. Hi. This is G's French teacher. Uh-huh. Right. Uh, you know what? I gotta fuck, right? Nice to meet you. My man. Joe, anyway, um... I'm out of here, Williams. What'd you do? Me? Nothing. Don't let him break you, honey. He'll be back on the street in no time. Didn't they tell you that you can go? So why don't you go? I'm after Lucas's pal, Kevin Swain. Wanted you to know, just in case. Who was that? Some trouble. Well, I'm gonna let you get back to work, okay? All right, so listen. What we should do, right? What I think we should do, right, we should meet tonight, go have dinner, it's a nice place. Hello, Alex. Will you come? I'm gonna see if they lock you up, Rock. Even if I have to do it myself. Nobody's called me that in a long time. You murdered Billy Lucas. Who, Benny? Listen, I'm warning you. Stay away from Kevin Swain. He's mine. Unless he's in shackles. He's up for grabs. No, not this time. We'll go way back, you and me. I don't want to see you get hurt. I touched him, really. The thing about it is not to be trusted. These are two detectives working on the case. Alex Pratt, Deputy U.S. Marshal. How's it going? So what's this all about? Erica Rockler. The lieutenant was telling me that so far this looks clean. What are you saying, that it's not? I know it's not. Rock used to be one of us. She worked for the government. She was a marshal. And a good one, too. Until she lost a witness in a Treasury case. The two men suspected of... orchestrating that particular horror show, with Billy Lucas and Kevin Swain. So you think that it's revenge? Absolutely. She lost her witness and her career, not revenge. I'd say that's mild. Yes, sir. All righty, then. The feds say they're going to send over that file on Kevin Swain. as soon as possible. Which means never. You got it. So BCI says the man's got 14 priors for forgery, bond instead of $2 million, and like Lucas, a warrant was issued two weeks ago. If Erica bags him, that's 200 Gs in her pocket. That's a big payday. She's got a score to settle with this Lucas guy. Yeah, but we don't have any evidence to support murder. Motive, Ed. She lied to us. All right, fine. Why don't we start with her snitch? Erica says that she set her up, so maybe she'll want to ask why. All right, we got a girl by the name of... name of Crystal Wade, 110th and Pleasant. Where have you been? Ow! You're hurting me! Where's Lucas? We have a meet in two hours. I'm dead. What? How? Some bitch came sniffing around looking for both of you, so I called Lucas and told him about it. You said him? No, I didn't. I swear I didn't. He told me to page her, get her to come to the club. I just did what he said. I swear I did. Who is she? Her name's Erica. The cops locked her up. Where are you going? Shut up. What about me? I'm going with you. No, you're not. Yes, I am. Don't make this hard a swing. You won't survive. Shoot and kill. Whatever. It's you I need a lot. Hey, hold it! Back up! Drop it! Put it down. He's mine. Mrs. Vincent. I'm sorry about your loss. Camille, these are the detectives that'll be working the case. They're gonna find a bastard. Now, you were on the phone when this happened, is that right? He always called me when he worked nights. And let me know he was on the phone. All right. And what did you hear? A crash. Like something broke. Then Todd yelled and the phone went dead. Do you remember what he yelled? Hey. That's it? Was your husband suffering from depression? What difference does that make? I'm just covering all the bases, Donahue. You should know that. Ma'am, was he having problems on the job? No. My husband was not unhappy, and he was not... crazy. Someone killed him or don't you care? Nice technique, detectives. It's a hell of a way to treat one of your own. You went for the books, kid. How's that? Bench warrant bonded for two mil. Uncle Sam must want you bad. I want to make a call. I'm entitled to a call. That's my right. Sure, no problem. I mean, as soon as we process. just these other charges. Murder, fake money. I mean, that pretty much guarantees you life. What do you want? Where'd you get the money? What do I get? Oh, the mercy of the court and a smile on my face. Sweeten the deal. I'll lead you right to him. Meets in an hour, Riverside Underpass. Me with who? Deal first. No, you're in no position to bargain, baby. Well, maybe you should look at these C-notes again, baby. They're supposed to be counterfeiting. It's counterfeit proof. Tell you what, why don't you call the feds? I bet they make a deal. We'll see. So, Lieutenant, you think we can swing this? It's worth a shot. I'm gonna talk to the state's attorney and see what we have to offer. Don't do this, Lieutenant. It's a mistake. You can't play federal games with local talent. Your opinion doesn't count. And I'm doing you a favor by even allowing you in here, Ms. Rockler. Lieutenant, please, let me in. Let me take him in. Justice can sort out the rest. What you really want? You pal Pratt and the feds tell a difference. I knew Alex Pratt would fill you in. He used you. Really? How? By getting me out of the way. See, my motive is strictly money. His is prestige. He brings Swain in first. Hell, even Jana Reno would have to take notice. Let me take him in. I have to surrender him to the sheriff to collect my fee. Sorry, this is going to go down our way. Set it up, Williams. Yes, ma'am. Listen, Erica... It's okay, Williams. I already know how to bend over. Can you hear me? How's it going, Bates? I heard your legal battle has escalated. Yeah, that's why I'm here. My buyer's real interested in your plates. Of course. Come on, you're not gonna try to jack the price up on me, are you? Kevin, the free market is not for neophytes. I mean, you're in trouble. You need this deal. I don't. Unless Bates says something concrete, he's gonna walk. Yeah, but you know he's gonna be careful. I gotta get out of town. I'll let you know. Company. Damn, he made us. Let's go. The terrorists. What the hell is she doing here? What the hell are you doing? Getting my money. Let's go. Move it now, Kate. Do not shoot. Herb is unarmed. Go. Go. Come on. Come on. U.S. forces. Back off, Bill. This is a federal matter. It's Swain in the band. He is a protected witness. Back off. What the hell are you doing? My job. Get inside. Get inside, Cal. What's going on? Hey, you! Two years' work down the drain because your detectives couldn't master Surveillance 101. Watch how you talk about my men, Pratt, all right? And you're in no position to throw stones because you didn't even tell me that there was a federal operation going on in my jurisdiction. It wasn't my call. I protect the witness. That's it. You're a son of a bitch, Alex. Kenneth Swain murdered a witness under our protection, and you gave that lowlife snitch a deal. You have no evidence to prove that, and frankly, Rock, if you remember, there is nothing more important than the national interest. You already lost your store over this. Let it go. I need some air. Oh, yeah. Look, I don't like this any more than you do, but the fact is, we need bait to get Russell Bates. That money hits the streets, we won't recover for years. Yeah, right. So you're saying this promotion that you get for bringing him in is just gravy, right? Spare me the soapbox, detective. You're willing to make a deal with Swain to get it baked yourself. I was ready to send him to jail, not to some beach with a new idea and a pocket full of money. Most criminals who enter the program do time first. He's not going to do a day in time if it's up to you. I mean, besides, we've got solid proof against your boy for murder. A man can't stand trial if he no longer exists. Lou, come on. Oh, please, let it go, Torres. We should have processed him while we had him. Possessions, $9. to the law. Hey, Matt. The, um, paraffin test on Officer Vincent came back inconclusive. CSU said there were too many astringent chemicals present. Like what? Bleach would do it. Industrial strength cleaners. Suspicious enough that his hands were washed. Yeah, well, not if he just came out of the shower and was washing dishes. Yeah, right. Thanks. Thank you. Let's get out of here, huh? Is Detective Williams here? He'll be down in a sec. Park it. So, what'd you do this time? Gave a damn. I knew the system wasn't perfect, but I thought it worked. You're a cop? Not anymore. I don't want to end up a drunk or playing with my gun in the dark. Sorry. Don't waste that on me. You save that for the poor slobs like Williams. They need your pity. I haven't known J.C. very long, but he does not seem like the kind of man anyone should feel sorry for. Not yet, but it's coming. He's got that cop disease. Look, I don't know what you're talking about, but if J.C. wants to tell me something, I'd prefer he told me on his own. Then you're in for a long wait. You see, cops don't talk to anybody else but cops. Wives and girlfriends, they don't know Jack until they... come home and there's brains splattered all over the wall. You're exaggerating. Why is that? Look, the job comes first. Canceled dates, unanswered questions, mood swings, and if you have kids with cops, you can count on raising them your own damn self. There's one thing I know about JC, is that he takes a big part in raising his son. Well, have you ever talked to the boy's mother? I'm sure she might sing a different tune. You obviously don't know. I know them better than you do, and I just met them. Give J.C. a message for me. Tell him not to let it get to him. Not let what get to him? If he wants you to know, he'll tell you. Something wrong? Hey, yeah, um, I'm sorry. I meant to call you, I just... That's okay, don't worry about it. What happened? Just this case I'm working on, you know, the whole thing went bust. It's leaving a bad taste in my mouth. Well, I'm a good listener if you want somebody to talk to. Oh, thanks. Okay, well, uh, call me later? Will do. Oh, yeah, that... Um, that girl that was here earlier... Who, Erica? Yeah. She told me to tell you, don't let it get to you. She said that, huh? Yeah, she's wanting to talk. Did she say where she was going? Sorry. I'll see you later. Listen, I just want you to know I really did want to see you tonight. Yeah, me too. All right. Measure for measure Your love's so much pleasure Like a haunted melody You came inside and you captured me So, how do you want to handle this, Tommy? We've got to close this case on soon. Well, it's a suicide. Donnie, who tried to cover for his partner, took his gun from the scene. If we go for Warren, every cop on the squad is gonna be out by blood. He'd be stupid to keep it anyway. The wife. The wife's the weak link. We get her alone, it's over. We sure we want to do this. It means donning his career. And his wife's pension. I don't know what I'm supposed to think or feel. Well, I know this. Just because he pulled the trigger doesn't mean the job didn't kill him. I don't know. You know how to love me. I'm alright. I'm fresh away. You know how to love me. Tonight, when I want to sing. You know how to love me. May I help you? You and I? Yeah. Come in. So, um... I thought you were going to North Carolina. I don't like the country. So? So why do you live there, then? It's cheap. Cheap like what? What are you looking for, Williams? You have no business poking around in my fire! Pratt gave this to me. okay what does he have against you anyway I was his partner and I never told him that our witness had contact with the relative I lost my job and Alex lost a promotion so is that the reason why your witness was killed oh yeah he loved his wife and they knew it she refused to go into the program you can't see that a blamer all you get for your civic duty is a new birth certificate and twelve hundred dollars a month for a year and a half so why did he come forward because he was a damn fool who didn't know you witness a murder you mind your own business you don't make a description you don't finger the bastards and line up you don't give up your life because it's the right thing to do okay Come on. It's okay. Come here. Don't be nice to me, Will. No, come here. You don't need to cry, all right? It's gonna be fine. All right? Okay? Okay? What's it gonna be? I can't pretend Don't you wanna be Holdin' fresh All night and don't let go Don't let go You have me to get Don't let go I didn't tell you I know you think that we move too soon, it would all end. I live in misery when you're not around. And I won't be standing still till the chicken's all found. There'll be some love making, heart breaking, soul shaking. Oh, love making. Heartbreaking, soul shaking What you gonna be? Cause I can't pretend Don't you wanna be Don't you wanna be A woman's friend Hold me tight and don't let go Don't let go I have the right to lose You got the right You got the right I said you got the right to lose Woo! Country roads, yeah, yeah. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Don't let go. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. What's up, young? What's up? Sweeney and two deputy marshals were ambushed. Pratt's on my ass, and the feds are trying to take over my precinct. Other than that, Williams, it's quiet. Wait, did you see him? When? Around 11 o'clock last night. A woman matching Erica's description was seen at the hotel. I want an all-point out on her, and I want this mess cleared up before the brass door call on me. No, it wasn't her. Williams, I know how you feel. She's been through it and then some, but now it's out of my hands. No, Lieutenant, I know that it wasn't her, because she was with me last night. She was with you? Yeah, she was with me. Where is she now? She's at a hotel. He'll get her to us. What's the problem? What? What? I told you everything that I know. He yelled, hey, and we got that. Now, there wasn't much missing from your place. Maybe they got scared when they shot my husband. Why was Officer Vincent seeing a police rank? I thought that was confidential. It is. That's why I'm asking. I don't know. You didn't ask? He said it was for the job. For the job or because of it. See, cops lose it all the time. Need to get it off their chest. We cheat on our spouses. We drink. Even eat our guns. We got a saying around the squad. If you can get two shots off before the end, you're a real hard ass. See? He didn't kill himself. Then how did he get powder burns on his hand? We have a test for that, Camille. We checked his reports. He hadn't fired his weapon in weeks. And there was broken glass outside the window. If the perps broke in, the glass would have been on the floor. We're not stupid. He said you wouldn't know. What time did you leave the precinct? After everything that's happened. You can't believe that I did this. Well, you didn't pull the trigger because Detective Williams said you were together. Then why am I here? Because you went to the Regent Hotel. See, Swain was being held there before being moved to a safe house, and somehow, you're pretty the last found out. I wasn't there. Yes, you were, because somebody ID'd your photo. If I was with Williams, how do you explain it? Revenge? Change the record. This one's a little tired. You know, you're not the only one with a grudge, Erica. As of yesterday, Russell Bates... Williams, get back here. Prove it. Oh, I will. And I can't... Man, I got this. I got it. I guess I know how you feel, huh? Betrayed. Used. Then you get angry, right? And payback is the only thing that you can think about until she becomes a bitch all of a sudden. That's about right, isn't it? I mean, you played me well, girl. I mean, who else better to vouch for you than a cop? It wasn't like that. But this time I'm going to play you, all right? Now, you're right. We can't prove it. You're going to have to cooperate. And trust me when I tell you, you will when I'm done with you. I'm out of here. You sit your ass right here. Are you? went to Bates, you told him where to find Swain. You told him how the marshals operate. He ends up dead. So whether or not you gave it to him for free or you sold it to him, you did it, we know it, and you're going to pay for that. How, Williams? I'm going to go to Bates, just like you did. And I'm going to tell him we got you on two counts of conspiracy to murder U.S. Deputy Marshals and one Kevin Swain. Then I'm going to tell him it's just a matter of time before you serve him up to us on the planet. Who think you're posturing? I will, Willie. And you're willing to take that risk. I don't believe you. It's not your style. All right. Good. The meat's set. Remember, bait's no joke. You just better make sure you cover my ass. You're a protected witness, whether I like it or not. I told you before, we'll do anything to get baits, even give you a deal. Listen, the purse is wired in the lining. The pager is the backup. Now, the range isn't good on either one, so... We're gonna have to be close. Just get Bates to say something incriminating, and then we'll come in. I know what you mean. Williams. Can I have a minute? I'm never meant to hurt you. I just couldn't let Swain get away again. Let me ask you something. If you get away with doing the same thing, then what makes you feel better? What makes you different than him? Look, I couldn't take the national interest anymore. The snitches and the finks, double-dipping between federal agencies. We spent over $100 million on snitches last year. Swain was the last straw. That's very noble, Erica. Why don't you write a book? Huh. The reason why I chose you is because I knew you wouldn't leave me twisting in the wind. I knew you were a good cop. their mouths about us. It's not my morals that I question. It's just my taste. Move your hands a little to the left. I might get something out of this too. She's clean. For a woman, you travel very light. Makeup's in the car. You want it? Some men appreciate a sharp wit in a female. I'm not one of them. When we talked yesterday, you didn't seem to mind. I don't know what you're talking about. I gave you a freebie. You said butchers instead of somebody subtle. Sure. So get to the point. I got cops asking me questions. I don't like it. Slippery son of a bitch. He hasn't said a damn thing we can use. I could give you a loan to help you straighten out your problems. Fortunately, don't keep any cash in your pocket. Come on, do something, Rock. How much we talking here? I gave you Swain's whereabouts. Two marshals got killed. How much you need? Enough to get lost. fair enough go with my associate he'll take care of you what the hell is she doing you're proud your witness is leaving she left one of the transmitters in the office we have to stay in range so where are we going anyway so You know what? I know this city like the back of my hand. If you take Houston, you're gonna hit traffic, so maybe we should turn up this street a bit. Now, which street did she say, man? I've lost her, really. I'm static. Okay, I got a little belt. Don't worry about it. Yes, sir, I understand. Okay. Uh, don't take this personally. I don't like people sitting behind me. If you could just move over, I'd appreciate it. Yeah, sure. Where is she? Come on, is there anything coming through, yeah? Nothing. There they are. All units, suspect sight. Alley behind the mountain, chambers. Out of the car! Let's go, let's go! Where is she? Get up! Where is she? Out of the car, will you? Hey, fuck! There we are. What the hell is she? He hear me talking to you? Say, see. Move, Edmund. You're done now. Sit down, Don, if you... Unless you want to tell your story to one police plaza. What difference does it make who I talk to? If the girls don't report that you staged this whole thing, the brass won't be satisfied with just your resignation. Did Officer Vincent take his own life? Maybe you forgot what it's like out there on the street. And hell, you gold shields don't show up till the smoke's cleared anyway. We still got our shaft. Believe me. You don't see some guy beating the crap out of his wife. Or watch some kid blow her brains out, and you never find out why. So he eats his own life. gun and leads you to clean up his mess he was my partner what's this officer Todd Vincent died from a gunshot wound fired by an unknown assailant Hey, bonjour. If you're looking for G, he went that way with Nikki. No, I thought I'd come see you and say hello. Hello. So, um, how have you been? I've been all right. I haven't seen you around. in a while. Yeah, um, you know that woman who was working on that case? Yeah, Erica. Well, she was killed. JC, I'm so sorry. Yeah, me too. So I needed to, you know, just take time away. I know we didn't get off to the best start, so what I want to try to do is make it up to you. I don't think that'd be a good idea. Why not? JC, I don't always know what I want, but I know what I don't want. What, Jess? Second place. Not over a woman, not over a job, nothing. Who's talking about second place? And then, you know, people settle. And that's not me. So... Prince? I'm Rosanna Scotto coming up next for the second time this week a serious accident at a New York airport we'll go inside the home of the cult of death new details on how they took their own lives plus Their eerie final message, why were they so concerned about a comet and some UFOs? Also ahead, bye-bye Heisman Trophy. The judge tells OJ to pay up. There's a videotape that might help police find Notorious B.I.G.'s killer. You'd better make sure you've paid all your tickets when you see this woman coming with her computer or else. Why Charles Manson doesn't want to be free, and Martin Luther King Jr.'s son goes face-to-face with James Earl Ray. Put down that remote. The 10 o'clock news is next. Welcome to my world. Promise that you'll stay"

At\u00e9 deixei cair o chap\u00e9u. Oh! Oh? Ha! Por que ser\u00e1 que voltaram t\u00e3o cedo? Costumam demorar-se muito mais tempo. Mas porqu\u00ea? O que estar\u00e1 a acontecer? Este burburinho n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada vulgar. Talvez tenhamos sorte e aconte\u00e7a alguma coisa interessante. Ol\u00e1, minhoquinha.  Vais dar um passeio? Ser\u00e1 que sabes falar? N\u00e3o, n\u00e3o me parece que saiba falar. Ainda \u00e9 muito nova. A \u00fanica coisa que sabe fazer \u00e9 abrir a boca. Deve estar com fome. J\u00e1 sei! Deve haver problemas na colmeia. Fica do outro lado do castelo em ru\u00ednas, por tr\u00e1s daquele grande pinheiro. \u00c9 um lugar seguro e agrad\u00e1vel.  O que \u00e9 que se passa? Porqu\u00ea que n\u00e3o me deixas entrar?

Sim, Maia Temos estado aqui \u00e0 tua espera Foste a \u00faltima a nascer Quem \u00e9, Maia? Sou eu, a Maia Porqu\u00ea que me chamou Maia? Diga-me, por favor Bem, na verdade, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 nenhuma raz\u00e3o especial Toda a gente tem um nome A senhora tamb\u00e9m tem um nome? Sim, chamo-me Cassandra Tome conta de voc\u00eas at\u00e9 serem grandes Vem c\u00e1 Vamos  Ainda bem que me convidas, est\u00e1 calor A culpa \u00e9 tua, as outras j\u00e1 sa\u00edram h\u00e1 muito tempo Porqu\u00ea que demoraste tanto? Tive um sonho lindo Um sonho? Mas, Maia, as abelhas nunca sonham Talvez um dia lhe conto o meu sonho, foi t\u00e3o divertido Bom, eu salto ou a Dona Cassandra vem-me c\u00e1 buscar? Espera, eu vou buscar-te Calma Abre Abre  A vida est\u00e1 apenas a come\u00e7ar e h\u00e1 tanta coisa para aprender. Oh! O que \u00e9 que elas est\u00e3o a fazer? Est\u00e3o a aprender a viver em enxame. Enxame? O que \u00e9 isso? As abelhas voam sempre em enxame. Porqu\u00ea? \u00c9 um bocadinho dif\u00edcil de perceber. Primeiro vou ensinar-te coisas mais f\u00e1ceis. Porqu\u00ea que elas fazem isso? N\u00f3s, as abelhas, fazemos isto desde que existimos. E porqu\u00ea que as abelhas fazem isso? Por que?  Porqu\u00ea que n\u00e3o me diz, professora Cassandra? Quero saber porqu\u00ea! Como \u00e9 que vou aprender alguma coisa sobre a vida se a senhora n\u00e3o me explica? Seja paciente, m\u00e3e. Eu n\u00e3o te posso explicar tudo de uma vez. V\u00e1, vamos ter com as outras. Ah! E dentro dos favos colocam-se os ovos. E porqu\u00ea que fazem isso? Os ovos ficam dentro de favos e passadas algumas semanas...  Nasce uma abelhinha, como aconteceu contigo. Estive num ovo igual \u00e0quelas? Se veste. V\u00ea como elas colocam um ovo em cada buraquinho. Depois vem outra abelha que fecha o orif\u00edcio com cera. S\u00e3o as obreiras, que s\u00f3 trabalham dentro da colmeia. S\u00e3o elas que constroem a colmeia e tomam conta dos ovos. Tenham sempre muito o que fazer, pois todos os dias a abelha-mestra p\u00f5e um grande n\u00famero de ovos. N\u00e3o me parece que te lembra?  Lembres-te como era quando estavas dentro do ovo, pois n\u00e3o? Onde \u00e9 que estar\u00e1 aquela mi\u00fada? \u00c9 pesado. Consegui! Ah, est\u00e1s a\u00ed!  Est\u00e1 a ver, professora Cassandra, eu tamb\u00e9m consigo \u00d3timo, mas \u00e9 s\u00f3 um ovo por cada buraquinho Mas porqu\u00ea? Se os ovos ficassem aos pares, podiam falar uns com os outros Assim j\u00e1 n\u00e3o se sentiam t\u00e3o sozinhos Maia, n\u00f3s as abelhas n\u00e3o nascemos para conversar, nascemos para trabalhar Estou muito preocupada contigo, tens umas ideias muito estranhas nessa cabecinha Eu gosto da minha ideia, dois ovos em vez de um Minha querida Maia, a experi\u00eancia prova que \u00e9 melhor um s\u00f3 ovo Sim  Mas diga-lhe porqu\u00ea que \u00e9 melhor Faz\u00edamos divis\u00f5es maiores para mais ovos Anda, vamos l\u00e1 Ah, que bem que cheira Que fome E \u00e9 mesmo bom, o cheiro que est\u00e1s a sentir \u00e9 do mel  Por que n\u00e3o consigo levantar isto como fazem as outras?  Deixa isso, \u00e9 muito pesado para ti Isto \u00e9 mel? Sim, \u00e9 aqui que armazenamos o mel Maya, volta aqui j\u00e1! Isto \u00e9 delicioso!  \u00c9s mesmo endiabrada Ficaste toda suja, Maia O mel sabe bem Mas \u00e9 t\u00e3o pegajoso que n\u00e3o consigo mexer as asas Agora que j\u00e1 s\u00e3o mais crescidos Vou lev\u00e1-los numa viagem ao mundo exterior para verem o c\u00e9u Pronto  Professora Cassandra, pode dizer-me o que \u00e9 o c\u00e9u? Gostava de saber. Espera at\u00e9 l\u00e1 chegarmos. Depois explico-te tudo. Mas n\u00e3o penses que o mundo l\u00e1 fora \u00e9 s\u00f3 divers\u00e3o? As abelhas pequeninas n\u00e3o podem andar l\u00e1 fora sozinha, percebeste? O mundo l\u00e1 fora \u00e9 perigoso. Tenho de perceber como \u00e9 cruel e ter muito cuidado. Sim, eu sei, professora Cassandra. Eu j\u00e1 ando nesta aula h\u00e1 dois anos. Ent\u00e3o deves saber que isto \u00e9 uma vespa e que h\u00e1 inimigos ainda piores, dez vezes maiores do que n\u00f3s.  Tenham muito cuidado com eles N\u00e3o tenham medo, voltem para os vossos lugares N\u00e3o h\u00e1 vespas dentro da colmeia Elas n\u00e3o podem entrar, por isso n\u00e3o precisam de ter medo nenhum, minhas pequeninas Isto \u00e9 uma r\u00e3 Nunca voem muito baixo sobre a \u00e1gua Sen\u00e3o isto \u00e9 o que pode acontecer Elas t\u00eam uma l\u00edngua muito comprida N\u00e3o se preocupem, as r\u00e3s nunca poder\u00e3o entrar aqui Ah, professora Cassandra \u00c9?  Isso quer dizer que nunca nos devemos aproximar das r\u00e3s. Isso mesmo, Willy. N\u00e3o se esque\u00e7am. Tu \u00e9s o Willy? Sim, sou o Willy. Parece ser muito esperto. N\u00e3o, eu j\u00e1 ando nesta aula h\u00e1 dois anos. Bem, eu sou a Maya. J\u00e1 ouviste falar de mim? Sim, mas s\u00f3 coisas terr\u00edveis. Fa\u00e7o tantas perguntas \u00e0s pessoas que lhes d\u00e1 vontade de gritar. O mundo pode ser muito cruel. Por exemplo, quando chove n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada agrad\u00e1vel. Quando isso acontecer, voltem para casa ou escondam-se debaixo de uma favela.  Se estiver a chover l\u00e1 fora, qual \u00e9 a melhor coisa que uma abelha pode fazer? Queres ser tu a responder, Willy? Bem, devemos ficar em casa O que \u00e9 que aconteceria se n\u00e3o fic\u00e1ssemos em casa, professora? Eu acabei de vos dizer, querida Que barulho \u00e9 este? Por favor, n\u00e3o saiam dos vossos lugares, eu volto j\u00e1 O que \u00e9 que estar\u00e1 a acontecer? Deve haver algum problema Maia, Maia  Maia, onde \u00e9 que vais? Volta! Volta aqui! Vou l\u00e1 fora! N\u00e3o, Maia! Maia, volta! N\u00e3o \u00e9 seguro ir l\u00e1 para fora O que \u00e9 que est\u00e3o a fazer? Toma! Toma! Toma!  \u00c9 meu! N\u00e3o, n\u00e3o \u00e9! \u00c9 meu! Isso \u00e9 da professora Cassandra! N\u00e3o \u00e9! Tudo \u00e9 que vejo este pote. O que \u00e9 que se passa aqui? Pronto, n\u00e3o chores mais, minha pequenina. Willie, tu \u00e9s o mais velho. V\u00ea l\u00e1 se imp\u00f5es alguma obra.  A ordem. Voc\u00eas ouviram o que eu disse? Eu \u00e9 que sou o respons\u00e1vel. Fa\u00e7am o que eu digo. Olha, \u00e9 uma vespa. N\u00e3o \u00e9 uma vespa a s\u00e9rio. \u00c9 aquela que vimos antes. \u00c9 s\u00f3 uma figura. Mas j\u00e1 que sou o respons\u00e1vel, vou-lhes mostrar outra coisa.  Isto \u00e9 uma aranha Mesmo feia E tamb\u00e9m perigosa Eu j\u00e1 vi uma a s\u00e9rio Chamava-se Marta e era mesmo m\u00e1 Isso \u00e9 mentira N\u00e3o, n\u00e3o \u00e9 Isto \u00e9 um dente de le\u00e3o N\u00e3o \u00e9 nada N\u00e3o precisa de nada Vai-se embora N\u00e3o, n\u00e3o \u3069\u3046\u3057\u3088\u3046  Que vento t\u00e3o forte que sopra l\u00e1 fora N\u00e3o \u00e9 mesmo nada agrad\u00e1vel O c\u00e9u j\u00e1 n\u00e3o \u00e9 azul A professora Cassandra disse que era azul  Ent\u00e3o ser\u00e1 esta Passa aqui Ai, professora Cassandra Willy, mas o que \u00e9 que tu est\u00e1s a fazer? Voc\u00eas deviam estar sossegadinhos e a estudar Obrigada, Willy Podes voltar para o teu lugar Maia, \u00e9s capaz de me dizer o que \u00e9 isto?  Mas onde \u00e9 que ela est\u00e1?

        "translated": "The story I'm going to tell Is full of magic and color And a bee will talk About nature and its splendor I asked her if her name was Maia In a world without equal fame Music Maia, what else to change Hello, friends! As you can see, I'm a grasshopper My name is Philip, I hope you like me I know I'm weird, but where do you get used to it? I come here often I don't know what story to tell you Nothing interesting has happened to me today It seems to me that the life of a grasshopper can be very boring Spending the day eating grass and hopping from one place to another isn't very exciting Although I like to eat Oh, yes I wish the butterfly were my friend Ana, come to me, I call you bees. They bring honey. Those little ones are so hard-working that I think they even work too much. They always fly to us, Allah! Did you collect a lot of honey today? Give me a little drop. It's really theirs, always busy. all day long. They don't even have time to say hello. How unusual. I even dropped my hat. Oh! Oh? Ha! Why are they back so early? They usually take much longer. But why? What's going on? This hubbub is not at all common. Maybe we'll get lucky and something interesting will happen. Hello, little worm. Are you going for a walk? Can you talk? No, I don't think she can talk. She's still very young. All she can do is open her mouth. She must be hungry. I know! There must be trouble in the hive. It's on the other side of the ruined castle, behind that big pine tree. It's a nice, safe place. What's going on? Why won't you let me in? You don't know who I am If you don't know the password, you can't come in I don't need a password, I'm Cassandra She was your teacher when you were in school Oh! Pedro? Finally We've been waiting for a long time They must be almost hatching Here they come, come on! They don't leave here. How do I get out of here? Is there a door here? It's Maia I'll have to break it Hello Is anyone home? Yes, Maia We've been waiting here for you You were the last one born Who is it, Maia? It's me, Maia Why did you call me Maia? Tell me, please Well, there's no special reason really Everyone has a name Do you have a name too? Yes, my name is Cassandra Take care of you until you grow up Come here Let's go I'm glad you invited me, it's hot It's your fault, the others left a long time ago Why did you take so long? I had a beautiful dream A dream? But, Maia, bees never dream Maybe one day I'll tell you my dream, it was so much fun Well, should I jump or will Dona Cassandra come and get me? Wait, I'll go and get you Calm down Open up Open up Life is just beginning and there is so much to learn. Oh! What are they doing? They are learning to live in a swarm. A swarm? What is that? Bees always fly in a swarm. Why? It is a little difficult to understand. First I will teach you some easier things. Why do they do that? We bees have been doing this since the beginning of time. And why do bees do that? Why? Why don't you tell me, Professor Cassandra? I want to know why! How am I going to learn anything about life if you don't explain it to me? Be patient, Mom. I can't explain everything to you at once. Come on, let's go and see the others. Ah! And the eggs are laid inside the honeycomb. And why do they do that? The eggs are laid inside the honeycomb and after a few weeks... A little bee is born, just like you. Have you been in an egg like those? Get dressed. See how they lay an egg in each little hole. Then another bee comes along and seals the hole with wax. They are the workers, who only work inside the hive. They are the ones who build the hive and take care of the eggs. They always have a lot to do, because every day the queen bee lays a large number of eggs. Don't you think that reminds you? Remember what it was like when you were inside the egg, don't you? Where is that little girl? It's heavy. I got it! Oh, there you are! You see, Professor Cassandra, I can do it too. Great, but it's only one egg for each little hole. But why? If the eggs were in pairs, they could talk to each other. That way they wouldn't feel so alone. Maia, we bees weren't born to talk, we were born to work. I'm very worried about you. You have some very strange ideas in that little head of yours. I like my idea, two eggs instead of one. My dear Maia, experience proves that one egg is better. Yes. But tell him why it's better We'd make bigger divisions for more eggs Come on, let's go Ah, how good it smells How hungry And it's really good, the smell you're feeling is honey Why can't I lift this like the others do? Leave it, it's too heavy for you. Is this honey? Yes, this is where we store Maya honey, come back here right now! This is delicious! You're really mischievous You got all dirty, Maia The honey tastes good But it's so sticky that I can't move my wings Now that they're older I'm going to take them on a trip to the outside world to see the sky Ready Professor Cassandra, can you tell me what heaven is? I'd like to know. Wait until we get there. I'll explain everything to you later. But don't you think that the outside world is just fun? Little bees can't go out alone, do you understand? The outside world is dangerous. I have to understand how cruel it is and be very careful. Yes, I know, Professor Cassandra. I've been in this class for two years. So you must know that this is a wasp and that there are even worse enemies, ten times bigger than us. Be very careful with them Don't be afraid, go back to your places There are no wasps inside the hive They can't get in, so you don't need to be afraid at all, my little ones This is a frog Never fly too low over the water Otherwise this is what can happen They have a very long tongue Don't worry, frogs will never be able to get in here Oh, Professor Cassandra Is that so? That means we should never go near frogs. That's right, Willy. Don't forget. Are you Willy? Yes, I'm Willy. You seem very smart. No, I've been in this class for two years. Well, I'm Maya. Have you heard of me? Yes, but only terrible things. I ask people so many questions that they want to scream. The world can be very cruel. For example, when it rains, it's not pleasant at all. When that happens, go home or hide under a shanty. If it's raining outside, what's the best thing a bee can do? Do you want to answer that, Willy? Well, we should stay home. What would happen if we didn't stay home, teacher? I just told you, dear. What's that noise? Please stay where you are, I'll be right back. What's going on? There must be something wrong, Maia, Maia. Maia, where are you going? Come back! Come back here! I'm going outside! No, Maia! Maia, come back! It's not safe to go outside. What are you doing? Take it! Take it! Take it! It's mine! No, it's not! It's mine! That's Professor Cassandra's! It's not! All I see is this pot. What's going on here? There, don't cry anymore, my little one. Willie, you're the oldest. See if you can impose some work. The order. Did you hear what I said? I'm the one in charge. Do what I say. Look, it's a wasp. It's not a real wasp. It's the one we saw before. It's just a figure. But since I'm the one in charge, I'll show you something else. This is a spider Really ugly And also dangerous I've seen a real one Its name was Marta and it was really bad That's a lie No, it's not This is a dandelion It's nothing It doesn't need anything Go away No, no What should I do? Such a strong wind is blowing outside It's really not pleasant The sky is no longer blue Teacher Cassandra said it was blue So this is it. Pass it here. Oh, teacher Cassandra Willy, but what are you doing? You should be quiet and studying. Thank you, Willy. You can go back to your place. Maia, can you tell me what this is? But where is she? Can anyone tell me where she is? Did anyone see her leave? Yes, teacher, I saw her leave I know exactly where she went She went to see the storm What a naughty child I have to keep an eye on that girl The world is beautiful again How funny that little green bug How funny that little green bug WE ARE AT HAND There, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there. Like a celestial chariot always turning. Oh! Spinning, always spinning One and two and three with me is fun Turn around and you'll see You'll understand This is a pleasure When we dance the flowers spin In the wind Give it to mom right there Come dance with me, sing with me, jump with me. Sing, play, have fun with me. Come dance, jump with me. Come, wake up, come dance and laugh with me One, two, three Like a car in the sky I'm always spinning Always spinning Spinning Come, you'll see it's fun Very good, very good! Maya! Maia, where are you, Maia? Where are you? Answer immediately It's Cassandra, your teacher Maia, where are you? Maia, Maia Now everything is resolved You always get yourself into trouble Have you seen a little bee? If you're looking for that cheeky girl, it's over there Let her stay there for a few minutes and see if she learns her lesson Maia It's the teacher Cassandra She should take advantage of the fact that you're in jail to stab you Sting! You were very naughty, Maia. I'm going to have to punish you and send you to bed right now. Oh, but I didn't do anything wrong. I just wanted to see the storm. It doesn't matter. You caused a lot of trouble. I apologize. And don't go out exploring the world again. Okay. I apologize. Go. Let me see. Stop standing there quietly and get some sleep. Why am I being naughty just for wanting to see the world outside? Next time I'll be smarter and run away when no one's looking. They'll never find me."

No debe extra\u00f1aros que no me conteste, es que no sabe hablar a\u00fan Es como los ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os, abre su boquita tan solo para que le den de comer Tengo una idea, ya que en la colmena debe ocurrir algo especial \u00bfQu\u00e9 os parece si vamos all\u00e1 para enterarnos, eh? En aquel castillo, al lado del gran abeto, est\u00e1 la colmena \u00a1Oye! \u00a1Oye! \u00a1Oye!  \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no me dej\u00e1is entrar? \u00bfNo sab\u00e9is qui\u00e9n soy? La contrase\u00f1a. Sin contrase\u00f1a no hay paso. Pero bueno, \u00bfes que no me reconoces? Soy Casandra, la que te ha ense\u00f1ado tu  Yo he sido tu maestra. \u00bfCon Casandra? Hoy es un gran d\u00eda. Nacer\u00e1n nuevos hermanos y hermanas. Pero si no me dej\u00e1is pasar, se asfixiar\u00e1n. Y vosotros aqu\u00ed haci\u00e9ndome perder el tiempo. Por favor, tranquil\u00edcese, se\u00f1orita Casandra. La comprendemos, pero debe comprendernos tambi\u00e9n a nosotros. Tenemos \u00f3rdenes que cumplir. Yo tambi\u00e9n tengo que obedecer \u00f3rdenes, pero hay que saber distinguir cuando una orden es una orden y cuando debe dejar de serlo, si el caso es urgente. Nosotros no pod\u00edamos saber que tuviera tanta importancia. Bueno, \u00bfme dej\u00e1is pasar o no? Pero claro, natural.  Normalmente, pase usted. Bien, ya estoy aqu\u00ed. Espero no llegar tarde. No, no, va a empezar en cualquier momento. Ya empieza, venga, deprisa.  Colocaros todas en fila \u00a1Oh, mira! \u00a1R\u00e1pido, daros tiempo! \u00a1Oh, mira!  \u00bfQu\u00e9 es esto? Es que no hay nadie. Y esto no se abre. Vaya, pues s\u00ed que empiezo bien esto. \u00bfEscuchas? Tiene que ser Maya. Todo lo tiene que hacer una misma.  \u00bfNo hay nadie? Pues claro que hay alguien. Sal de una vez, Maya. Vamos, date prisa. Eres la \u00fanica que falta. \u00bfMaya? \u00bfQui\u00e9n es Maya? Es que Maya soy yo. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 me ha puesto usted ese nombre? D\u00edgame. Pues no hay ninguna raz\u00f3n especial. Simplemente porque cada una ten\u00e9is que tener un nombre. \u00a1Aj\u00e1! \u00bfY usted tambi\u00e9n tiene un nombre? S\u00ed, yo soy la se\u00f1orita Casandra y hasta que seas mayor me ocupar\u00e9 de ti.  Me alegro de haber salido, estaba muy inc\u00f3moda T\u00fa has tenido la culpa, los dem\u00e1s han salido ya hace rato \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no saliste antes, peque\u00f1a? Es que estaba so\u00f1ando una cosa muy bonita \u00bfQu\u00e9 dices? \u00bfUna abeja so\u00f1ando? Hay que ver \u00bfQuiere que se lo cuente? Era una cosa muy divertida Uy, \u00bfc\u00f3mo funciona esto? Tengo que saltar o viene a buscarme Espera, ir\u00e9 a buscarte, Maya Me va a coger en brazos Ven, peque\u00f1a, ven, se acabaron los sue\u00f1os No  Ven, ahora te espera la realidad. Tendr\u00e1s que aprender muchas cosas. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 vuelan para aqu\u00ed? Est\u00e1n empezando a reunirse para el enjambre. \u00bfQue se van a reunir un enjambre? \u00bfQu\u00e9 es eso? No, he dicho que se re\u00fanen para el enjambre. No lo comprendo. Es muy pronto para que t\u00fa lo comprendas. Primero tendr\u00e1s que aprender cosas m\u00e1s sencillas. Ah, s\u00ed. \u00bfY para qu\u00e9 lo hacen, eh? Porque las abejas hacemos esto desde que empezamos a existir. \u00bfY por qu\u00e9 las abejas hacemos esto?  \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no me lo explicas, pero de manera que yo lo comprenda? \u00bfY c\u00f3mo voy a comprender las cosas si nadie me las explica? Pero, peque\u00f1a, una cosa tras otra, no todas al mismo tiempo. Ven, vamos con los dem\u00e1s. Bueno, vale. \u00bfY por qu\u00e9 una cosa tras otra? Porque tu cabecita es demasiado peque\u00f1a para comprenderlas todas. Espere, se\u00f1orita. Ya s\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 no me lo dice, porque usted tampoco lo sabe. Porque... Porque...  r\u00ede usted, yo no lo encuentro tan gracioso. \u00a1Ay, qu\u00e9 jaleo! \u00a1Ay, qu\u00e9 jaleo! \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa all\u00ed? \u00a1Ah! Parece que van a enjambrar. Por eso hay tanta excitaci\u00f3n. En realidad no pasa nada especial. En el d\u00eda de los nacimientos hay demasiadas abejas en la colmena y la mitad tiene que emigrar para buscarse una colmena nueva. Esto ya lo he visto.  He visto muchas veces, pero como no hay nada m\u00e1s interesante, seguir\u00e9 viendo como las abejas van y vienen. \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya, no vayas por all\u00ed! \u00bfNo? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no? Porque eso ya lo ver\u00e1s m\u00e1s adelante. Y haz el favor de no preguntar tanto, me vas a volver loca con tanto por qu\u00e9. Por all\u00ed enfrente est\u00e1 muy claro que hay all\u00ed. \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya, qu\u00e9date aqu\u00ed! Por aqu\u00ed se sale al mundo exterior, \u00bfverdad? Pero yo a\u00fan no puedo salir. Si lo sabes, vuelve ahora mismo. Buenos d\u00edas, se\u00f1orita.  Se\u00f1orita. Pero es que soy tan feo que le doy miedo, se\u00f1orita. Se\u00f1orita Casandra, \u00bfd\u00f3nde est\u00e1? \u00bfQu\u00e9? \u00bfPor fin miraste hacia afuera? \u00bfQui\u00e9n era ese? Era Flip, el saltamonte. Es un tipo bastante vago. Vive completamente solo, algo incomprensible para las abejas. Se\u00f1orita Casandra, ahora voy por all\u00ed. \u00a1Maya! Adi\u00f3s, se\u00f1orita. \u00a1Qu\u00e9 chiquilla est\u00e1! Esc\u00fachame bien, Maya. No puedo perder todo mi tiempo contigo. Espero que lo puedas comprender. S\u00ed, la compr\u00e9.  \u00bfPero qu\u00e9 hacen all\u00ed? Construyen panales nuevos. Y dentro de los panales colocan los huevos. \u00bfY por qu\u00e9 lo hacen? En los panales los huevos est\u00e1n protegidos. Y al cabo de algunas semanas nacen peque\u00f1as abejas como t\u00fa. \u00bfYo he sido un huevecito como ese? Naturalmente. \u00bfVes c\u00f3mo colocan un huevo en cada uno?  cada celda. \u00bfLo ves? Ahora viene otra abeja y cierra la entrada con cera. Esas son las abejas obreras que trabajan solamente en la colmena. Ellas construyen los panales y cuidan de los huevos. Tienen que trabajar mucho porque nuestra reina pone muchos huevos diariamente. Seguramente no te puedes imaginar que t\u00fa alg\u00fan d\u00eda tambi\u00e9n fuiste un huevo, \u00bfverdad? \u00a1Oh, Maya! \u00bfD\u00f3nde se ha metido esa peque\u00f1a?  \u00a1Ay, c\u00f3mo pesa! \u00a1Lo he conseguido! \u00a1Est\u00e1 ah\u00ed arriba! Ve, se\u00f1orita Casandra, ya lo s\u00e9 hacer. Espera un momento, solo un huevo en cada celda. \u00bfY por qu\u00e9? Cuando salgan, si son dos, podr\u00e1n entretenerse.  De la otra manera es demasiado aburrido. Pero Maya, nosotras no venimos a este mundo para entretenernos, sino para trabajar. Me sorprendes, hija m\u00eda. Yo nunca tuve pensamientos tan extra\u00f1os como t\u00fa. Sin embargo, creo que dos huevos en una celda es mejor. Pero la experiencia de cientos de a\u00f1os nos ha ense\u00f1ado que es mejor as\u00ed. \u00bfY por qu\u00e9 es mejor as\u00ed? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no se hacen celdas grandes para muchos huevos? Ven conmigo, s\u00edgueme.  \u00a1Qu\u00e9 bien huele aqu\u00ed! \u00bfDe d\u00f3nde viene? Me est\u00e1 entrando de repente mucha hambre. Ya lo s\u00e9, es por la miel que est\u00e1s oliendo.  Ay, pero porque no se mueve, tiene que moverse. D\u00e9jalo, pesa demasiado para ti. Todo esto est\u00e1 lleno de miel. S\u00ed, aqu\u00ed se guarda la miel para el invierno.  Vaya, ven aqu\u00ed ahora mismo, una abeja no debe ser golosa Se\u00f1orita, Casandra est\u00e1 riqu\u00edsima Oh, qu\u00e9 ni\u00f1a tan terrible eres Oh, qu\u00e9 ni\u00f1a tan terrible eres  Hay que ver c\u00f3mo te has puesto. Est\u00e1 muy rica, pero muy pegajosa. \u00a1Ay, no puedo m\u00e1s verme! Ma\u00f1ana, o a lo sumo pasado ma\u00f1ana, vais a salir por primera vez a ver el cielo azul. Se\u00f1orita Casandra, \u00bfpuede explicarme qu\u00e9 es un cielo azul? Espera a que pueda salir de la colmena, entonces te lo explicar\u00e9 todo. Pero no te creas que fuera todo...  Todo es diversi\u00f3n. Ninguna peque\u00f1a abeja debe volar sola afuera. \u00bfMe entiendes? Afuera os esperan muchos peligros y deb\u00e9is aprender cu\u00e1les son para evitarlos. S\u00ed, s\u00ed, se\u00f1orita Cassandra. Yo ya lo s\u00e9 porque he suspendido dos veces, s\u00ed. Bueno, Willy, entonces t\u00fa sabr\u00e1s que este es un avisp\u00f3n nuestro peor enemigo. Es diez veces m\u00e1s grande que nosotras. Cuidaros mucho de no encontraros con el ni\u00f1o. No, no os quer\u00eda asustar. Volved a vuestro sitio r\u00e1pido. Aqu\u00ed dentro no hay avispones.  Nuestras viejas abejas tienen mucho cuidado. No teng\u00e1is miedo. En esta l\u00e1mina veis a una rana. No vol\u00e9is nunca demasiado cerca del agua. Si su larga y pegabosa lengua os atrapa alguna vez, no hay forma de escapar. Bueno, calma, calma. Aqu\u00ed nunca podr\u00eda entrar una rana. Se\u00f1orita, \u00bfsignifica eso que no debemos acercarnos nunca a los sitios donde hay ranas? As\u00ed es, Willy. No lo olvide. \u00bfT\u00fa te llamas Willy? S\u00ed, yo soy Willy. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 tienes esa voz tan rara? Es la poes\u00eda.  \u00a1Pubertad! \u00a1Ya tengo dos a\u00f1os! Bueno, yo soy maya. \u00bfA lo mejor has o\u00eddo hablar de m\u00ed? S\u00ed, s\u00ed, pero solo cosas malas. Vuelves loca a la se\u00f1orita con tus preguntas y cosas as\u00ed. Como todo en esta vida, el mundo tiene dos caras. Una bonita y otra menos bonita. Si, por ejemplo, llueve o hay tormenta, no es nada bonito. En ese caso, hay que volver inmediatamente a la colmena o buscar refugio debajo de las hojas. Por ejemplo, hoy que llueve y hay mucho viento, \u00bfqu\u00e9 debe hacer una peque\u00f1a abeja obediente, eh? \u00bfLo sabes t\u00fa, Willy? S\u00ed, nos quedamos en la colmena.  \u00bfY qu\u00e9 le ocurrir\u00eda a una abeja que sale con este tiempo? Pero, peque\u00f1a, si te acabo de explicar. \u00bfPero qu\u00e9 l\u00edo es este? Quedaros en vuestros sitios enseguida vuelvo, \u00bfvale? \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa? Creo que con esta tormenta se deben de cerrar todas las portezuelas. \u00bfA d\u00f3nde vas? Voy a ver qu\u00e9 hay fuera. Pero, Maya, qu\u00e9date. \u00a1Maya!  No debe salir. Ven aqu\u00ed. \u00a1Vamos de ah\u00ed! \u00a1S\u00ed, que atamos! \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 os pon\u00e9is en el palo? Debe estar en el pupito. \u00a1Est\u00e1 quieto!  Pero bueno, \u00bfde d\u00f3nde sale este florero? \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa aqu\u00ed? \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa aqu\u00ed? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 lloras, vamos? \u00a1Ay, qu\u00e9 ansia! Los dem\u00e1s los pod\u00e9is callar. Willy, t\u00fa eres el mayor aqu\u00ed. Pon un poco de orden. Ya lo hab\u00e9is o\u00eddo. Debo poner orden en todo esto. \u00a1Callaos ya!  \u00a1Uy! \u00a1Un rev\u00e9s pollo! \u00a1Un rev\u00e9s pollo! Pero no es verdad. Es el que hemos visto antes. Ya nos acord\u00e1is, \u00bfeh? Como soy el profesor, ahora os voy a ense\u00f1ar otra cosa. Ahora es una ara\u00f1a. La ara\u00f1a ara\u00f1a. Por eso  se llama ara\u00f1a, \u00bfest\u00e1 claro? \u00a1S\u00ed! He visto un al pasar, se llama tecla y estaba tocando el viol\u00edn. Willy, creo que est\u00e1s loco. No, no, no estoy loco, ella toc\u00f3 el viol\u00edn. Esto es un tulip\u00e1n, la miel del tulip\u00e1n. \u00bfEs un tulip\u00e1n? \u00bfNo te lo crees ni t\u00fa? Tambi\u00e9n un maestro tiene derecho a equivocarse, \u00bfno?  \u00a1M\u00fasica! \u00a1Vaya viento que hace! \u00a1No, el mundo no es as\u00ed!  tan maravilloso como afirman. Y dicen que el cielo es azul. \u00bfQu\u00e9 tiene de bonito todo esto? Yo creo que es un tulipano.  \u00a1Pero Willy! \u00a1Ah, se\u00f1orita Casandra! \u00bfQu\u00e9 haces aqu\u00ed? \u00bfY vosotros no os he dicho que os qued\u00e9is en vuestros sitios? He vigilado para que no hagan tonter\u00edas. Muy bien, Willy, ahora si\u00e9ntate. Bien, Maya, \u00bfquieres decirme lo que es esto? \u00bfEh? \u00a1Oh, Maya, \u00bfd\u00f3nde est\u00e1? \u00bfSabe alguien d\u00f3nde est\u00e1? \u00bfAlguien la ha visto salir? S\u00ed, yo la he visto. Ha salido. Tambi\u00e9n s\u00e9 d\u00f3nde est\u00e1.  \u00bfD\u00f3nde ha ido? Quer\u00eda ver la tormenta. \u00a1Oh! \u00a1Qu\u00e9 chiquilla tan desobediente! No me da m\u00e1s que disgustos, nada m\u00e1s que disgustos. Mira, ya parece otra cosa. Si el mundo estuviera siempre tan lleno de colores y el cielo tan azul... \u00a1Ah\u00ed va! \u00a1Ah\u00ed est\u00e1 el tipo divertido de antes! Soy un saltamontes que le gusta el sol.  Y saltar sin parar, me divierto mucho en cualquier lugar, viendo a todos trabajar.  La abeja maya tengo que cuidar Si se va del panal Pero es tan traviesa que me va a irritar Siempre quiere ir a jugar  De un gran salto voy lejos a buscar a mi buena maya que vuelve sin valor. Todos me conocen y me llaman Flip, yo soy Flip, el gran Flip, cuento las historias que se ven aqu\u00ed.  en mi peque\u00f1o pa\u00eds. Soy un saltamontes que le gusta el sol, yo soy Flip. Todos me conocen,  No conocen ni me llaman Flip, el gran Flip. El gran Flip. Soy el saltamontes Flip. \u00a1Bravo, bravo! \u00a1Muy bien hecho! \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya, \u00bfd\u00f3nde se habr\u00e1 metido? \u00a1Maya, \u00bfd\u00f3nde est\u00e1s? \u00a1Cont\u00e9stame! \u00a1Maya, cont\u00e9stame!  \u00a1Contesta! Soy la se\u00f1orita Cassandra. \u00bfPero qu\u00e9 dice? \u00bfA qu\u00e9 viene tanto grito? Si no contestas ahora mismo. Si por casualidad busca ese energ\u00fameno malcriado que casi nos tira al pasar, lo encontrar\u00e1 por all\u00ed. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 dice tantas tonter\u00edas? \u00a1Maya! Deber\u00eda aprovechar la ocasi\u00f3n y darte unos azotes ahora que no te puedes mover. \u00a1Uy! Bueno, voy a decirte una cosa, hija.  Hija m\u00eda, como no quieres obedecerme en nada, te castigar\u00e9 y te meter\u00e9 inmediatamente en la cama. \u00a1Oh, es necesario eso! No he hecho nada malo, solo quer\u00eda echar una tirada al punto. Pero a ver, \u00bfde d\u00f3nde vamos a llegar si todo el mundo hace lo que le apetece? Para que lo sepas, los ni\u00f1os tan curiosos me son antip\u00e1ticos. Bueno, bueno, ya est\u00e1 bien. Y te recomiendo que te quedes muy quietecita y que te duermas. Bueno, puede que hiciera mal al escaparme, pero \u00bfpor qu\u00e9? Si yo quiero saber qu\u00e9 aspecto...  \u00bfQu\u00e9 tanto tiene el mundo exterior? \u00bfEs tan malo eso? Ya s\u00e9 lo que voy a hacer. La pr\u00f3xima vez tendr\u00e9 m\u00e1s cuidado para que no me descubran. Eso es, as\u00ed lo har\u00e9. S\u00ed, se\u00f1or.",
        "translated": "In a multi-colored country, a bee was born under the sun, and was famous in the place, for her blessing and her kindness. And the little bee was called tomorrow, this beautiful sweet one. Oh, that endless grandmother! In her world without evil! There is no problem she doesn't solve! Oh! The naughty and sweet bee! Oh! Oh, I love you! Oh! Oh! Maya, Maya, come now The birth of Maya Huh? Oh, good morning, good morning to everyone! As you can see, I'm a grasshopper and my name is Flea. And I want to be your friend because we're going to be seeing each other for many days. Well, I'm sure we'll get along just fine. Well, I don't know what to tell you right now because lately it seems like nothing is happening around here. You can believe me, the life of a grasshopper is sometimes quite boring, always jumping around and eating grass. It gets monotonous, monotonous. I'm going to take a look. Oh, look! A butterfly! And yonder I see a swarm of bees They must have been collecting honey You must admit that bees are very hard-working I think they're going back to their hive Good morning, ladies! Good morning! Why don't you drop a few drops of honey? A drop, a drop Well, even though I have a lot to do today They could at least say good morning. What strange behaviour. It's not like them, isn't it? It's not like them at all. Where's my hat? It's so windy that my hat is blowing off. But here they are again. Something extraordinary must be happening. Hey, hey! What's the matter with them? Oh, how strange! They're flying around, back and forth, back and forth, like crazy. Hello, little one, taking a walk? You shouldn't be surprised that he doesn't answer me, it's just that he doesn't know how to talk yet. He's like a little child, he only opens his little mouth so that they can feed him. I have an idea, since something special must be going on in the hive. How about we go there and find out, eh? In that castle, next to the big fir tree, is the hive. Hey! Hey! Hey! What's wrong? Why won't you let me in? Don't you know who I am? The password. Without a password, there's no way through. But anyway, don't you recognize me? I'm Cassandra, the one who showed you your name. I have been your teacher. With Cassandra? Today is a great day. New brothers and sisters will be born. But if you don't let me in, they will suffocate. And here you are, wasting my time. Please calm down, Miss Cassandra. We understand you, but you must understand us too. We have orders to follow. I have to follow orders too, but you have to know when an order is an order and when it should stop being one, if the case is urgent. We couldn't know that it was so important. Well, will you let me in or not? But of course, of course. Normally, come in. Well, I'm here now. I hope I'm not late. No, no, it's going to start any minute. It's starting now, come on, hurry up. Get in line all together Oh, look! Quick, give it time! Oh, look! What is this? There's no one here. And this won't open. Wow, I'm off to a good start here. Do you hear? It has to be Maya. She has to do everything herself. Nobody's there? Of course there is. Come on, Maya. Come on, hurry up. You're the only one missing. Maya? Who's Maya? Maya is me. Why did you give me that name? Tell me. There's no special reason. Just because each of you has to have a name. Aha! And you have a name too? Yes, I'm Miss Cassandra and I'll take care of you until you're older. I'm glad I got out, I was so uncomfortable It's your fault, the others left a while ago Why didn't you get out sooner, little one? I was dreaming a very nice thing What are you saying? A bee dreaming? Oh, do you want me to tell you? It was a very funny thing Oops, how does this work? I have to jump or he'll come for me Wait, I'll come for you, Maya He's going to pick me up Come, little one, come, no more dreams No Come, now reality awaits you. You will have to learn many things. Why do they fly here? They are beginning to gather for the swarm. Are they going to gather for a swarm? What is that? No, I said they gather for the swarm. I don't understand. It's too early for you to understand. You will have to learn simpler things first. Oh, yes. And what do they do it for, eh? Because bees have been doing this since we began to exist. And why do bees do this? Why don't you explain it to me, but in a way that I understand? And how am I supposed to understand things if nobody explains them to me? But, little one, one thing after another, not all at once. Come, let's go with the others. Well, okay. And why one thing after another? Because your little head is too small to understand them all. Wait, little lady. I know why you don't tell me, because you don't know either. Because... Because... You laugh, I don't find it so funny. Oh, what a mess! Oh, what a mess! What's going on there? Ah! It looks like they're going to swarm. That's why there's so much excitement. Nothing special is really happening. On the day of the births there are too many bees in the hive and half of them have to migrate to find a new hive. I've seen that before. I've seen it many times, but since there's nothing more interesting, I'll just keep watching the bees come and go. Maya! Maya, don't go over there! No? Why not? Because you'll see that later. And please don't ask so many questions, you'll drive me crazy with all your whys. It's very clear what's there over there. Maya! Maya, stay here! This is where you get out to the outside world, right? But I can't get out yet. If you know, come back right now. Good morning, young lady. Miss. But I'm so ugly that I scare you, Miss. Miss Cassandra, where are you? What? Did you finally look outside? Who was that? It was Flip, the grasshopper. He's quite a lazy fellow. He lives all alone, which is incomprehensible to the bees. Miss Cassandra, I'll be right over there. Maya! Goodbye, Miss. You're such a little girl! Listen to me carefully, Maya. I can't waste all my time with you. I hope you can understand. Yes, I bought her. But what do they do there? They build new honeycombs. And inside the honeycombs they lay their eggs. And why do they do that? In the honeycombs the eggs are protected. And after a few weeks little bees like you are born. Was I an egg like that? Of course. Do you see how they lay an egg in each one? each cell. Do you see? Now another bee comes and seals the entrance with wax. These are the worker bees that work only in the hive. They build the honeycombs and take care of the eggs. They have to work hard because our queen lays many eggs every day. You probably can't imagine that you were once an egg too, right? Oh, Maya! Where has that little one gone? Oh, how heavy it is! I've got it! It's up there! Go on, Miss Cassandra, I know how to do it. Wait a minute, only one egg in each cell. And why? When they come out, if there are two of them, they can amuse themselves. It is too boring otherwise. But Maya, we are not brought into this world for entertainment, but for work. You surprise me, my daughter. I have never had such strange thoughts as you. However, I believe that two eggs in one cell is better. But the experience of hundreds of years has taught us that it is better this way. And why is it better this way? Why are not large cells made for many eggs? Come with me, follow me. It smells so good in here! Where is it coming from? I'm suddenly feeling very hungry. I know, it's because of the honey you're smelling. Oh, but because it doesn't move, it has to move. Leave it alone, it's too heavy for you. This is all full of honey. Yes, honey is stored here for the winter. Come here right now, a bee must not be greedy Miss, Cassandra is delicious Oh, what a terrible girl you are Oh, what a terrible girl you are You've got such a mess. It's so nice, but so sticky. Oh, I can't stand to look at myself anymore! Tomorrow, or at the latest the day after tomorrow, you're going out to see the blue sky for the first time. Miss Cassandra, can you explain to me what a blue sky is? Wait until I can get out of the hive, then I'll explain everything to you. But don't think that's all... It's all in good fun. No little bee should fly alone outside. Do you understand me? There are many dangers waiting for you outside and you must learn what they are in order to avoid them. Yes, yes, Miss Cassandra. I know that because I have failed twice, yes. Well, Willy, then you know that this is a hornet, our worst enemy. It is ten times bigger than us. Be very careful not to meet the boy. No, I didn't want to scare you. Go back to your place quickly. There are no hornets in here. Our old bees are very careful. Don't be afraid. In this picture you see a frog. Never fly too close to water. If its long, sticky tongue ever catches you, there's no way out. Now, calm down, calm down. A frog could never get in here. Miss, does that mean we must never go near places where there are frogs? Yes, Willy. Don't forget it. Is your name Willy? Yes, I am Willy. Why do you have such a strange voice? It's poetry. Puberty! I'm two years old now! Well, I'm Maya. Maybe you've heard of me? Yes, yes, but only bad things. You drive the young lady crazy with your questions and such. Like everything in life, the world has two sides. One pretty and one not so pretty. If, for example, it rains or there's a storm, it's not pretty at all. In that case, you have to go back to the hive immediately or find shelter under the leaves. For example, today when it's raining and it's very windy, what should a little obedient bee do, eh? Do you know that, Willy? Yes, we stay in the hive. And what would happen to a bee that goes out in this weather? But, little one, I've just explained it to you. What's all this mess about? Stay where you are, I'll be right back, okay? What's the matter? I think all the doors must be closed in this storm. Where are you going? I'm going to see what's outside. But, Maya, stay. Maya! He mustn't be out. Come here. Let's go from there! Yes, we'll tie him up! Why are you all standing on the pole? He must be in the little seat. He's still! But where did this vase come from? What's going on here? What's going on here? Why are you crying, come on? Oh, how anxious! The rest of you can shut up. Willy, you're the oldest here. Put some order in here. You heard me. I must put order in all this. Shut up now! Oops! A chicken backhand! A chicken backhand! But it's not true. It's the one we saw before. You remember us, right? Since I'm the teacher, I'm going to show you something else now. Now it's a spider. The spider spider. That's why It's called a spider, is that clear? Yes! I saw one in passing, it's called a key and it was playing the violin. Willy, I think you're crazy. No, no, I'm not crazy, she played the violin. This is a tulip, the honey of the tulip. Is it a tulip? You don't even believe it yourself? A master has the right to make mistakes, doesn't he? Music! What a wind it's blowing! No, the world isn't like that! as wonderful as they say. And they say the sky is blue. What's so beautiful about all this? I think it's a tulip. But Willy! Oh, Miss Cassandra! What are you doing here? And didn't I tell you to stay where you were? I've been watching to make sure you don't do anything stupid. All right, Willy, now sit down. Now, Maya, will you tell me what this is? Huh? Oh, Maya, where is she? Does anyone know where she is? Did anyone see her leave? Yes, I did. She left. I know where she is, too. Where has she gone? She wanted to see the storm. Oh! What a naughty little girl! She gives me nothing but trouble, nothing but trouble. Look, she seems different now. If only the world were always so full of colour and the sky so blue... There she goes! There she is, the funny guy from before! I am a grasshopper who likes the sun. And jumping non-stop, I have a lot of fun anywhere, watching everyone work. Maya the bee I have to take care of If she leaves the hive But she is so naughty that she will irritate me She always wants to go and play With a great leap I go far away to find my good Maya who returns without value. Everyone knows me and calls me Flip, I am Flip, the great Flip, I tell the stories that are seen here. in my little country. I'm a grasshopper who likes the sun, I'm Flip. Everyone knows me, They don't know me or call me Flip, the great Flip. The great Flip. I'm Flip the grasshopper. Bravo, bravo! Well done! Maya! Maya! Maya, where has he gone? Maya, where are you? Answer me! Maya, answer me! Answer! I'm Miss Cassandra. What are you saying? What's all the shouting about? If you don't answer right now. If you happen to look for that spoiled brat who nearly knocked us over as we passed, you'll find him there. Why are you talking so much nonsense? Maya! I ought to take this opportunity and spank you now that you can't move. Oops! Well, I'll tell you one thing, my dear. My child, since you do not want to obey me in anything, I will punish you and put you to bed immediately. Oh, that is necessary! I have done nothing wrong, I only wanted to have a quick laugh. But look, where are we going to get to if everyone does what they like? Just so you know, I do not like curious children. Well, well, that is enough. And I recommend that you keep very still and go to sleep. Well, perhaps I was wrong to run away, but why? If I want to know what I look like... How much of the outside world is there? Is it so bad? I know what I'm going to do. Next time I'll be more careful so I don't get caught. That's it, I'll do it. Yes, sir."

If she gives this information to the police, it won't take them very long to figure out that Kira is actually me. I have no choice but to eliminate her. Something wrong? Oh, it's nothing. But the more I think about it...  The more your theory makes sense to me. We can't waste any time. We need to start investigating it right away. What? Really? Do you mean that? Yes. So, have you told anyone else about this? No. You're the first person I've told. You're lucky. But how will you get rid of her? It's not like you can do it here. Well, you have a gift for stating the obvious, Rick. Aren't you bold? Let's get started. Could you please tell me the date and time of your...  of the bus jacking incident? It was December 20th in front of Asagao Hill at 11.02 a.m., bound for Spaceland. December 20th, and they were on their way to Spaceland. Yes. This way, no one will find her body. And even if they do, they'll just assume that she's dead.  The death of her fianc\u00e9 drove her to commit suicide. What's so funny, Ryuki? I apologize for questioning all of you like that, but I'm afraid I had no other choice. I've determined that Kira is not among us. Ryuzaki, how can you be certain that we're all innocent? Well, to be honest, from the beginning I set a number of traps that  would reveal if any of you was Kira. But after speaking with you one-on-one, I don't feel the need. Excuse me? Unbelievable. He tells us to turn off our cell phones. Understood. I'm just about finished here anyway. You've got the key, so let yourself in. Watari's on his way. Uh-huh. So that's everything. I'd like to report this to the police.  incident to my father if it's okay with you that is well if it's all the same I think I'd like to report it myself and after talking to you I've decided that it would be best to do it as soon as possible that makes sense just 10 seconds until 1 15 I have to admit I'd really love to see how she dies but I can't be caught following her around go on  Hurry to your death. Kida will definitely be caught. Don't you think? Uh-huh. What's going on? It should have happened already.  This doesn't make sense. I don't understand why she's not leaving. I've had no problems making people kill themselves in the past. All I had to do was write the word suicide. The criminals I tested it on all hung themselves exactly when I specified. My experiments indicate that in a situation like this, I should be able to control a person's actions. So, what's wrong? Rick...  He laughed just like that when I was writing in the death note. And that's not all. I remember thinking it was bizarre how he laughed when I asked for her name. In fact, he's reacted the same way every time her name comes up. An alias? Gentlemen, it's an honor to meet all of you. This person is Watari?  Um, what about your usual outfit? If I dressed like that, I'd be announcing to the world that I am Watari. That's all it takes to give away the location of our headquarters in Ryuzaki. Oh, I see. Ordinarily, I would never show my face to any of you. The fact that I'm here is proof that you've won Ryuzaki's trust. Now that you mention it, I do feel honored. Well then, I brought those items you requested. It's all here. Could you please pass them out to everyone? Yes.  Yes. Gentlemen, these are your new police IDs. But what for? She used an alias. That has to be it. Ryuk knew all along. He could see her real name with his eyes. That's why he wouldn't stop laughing. I should have known. She's been overly cautious from the beginning. I see. It makes a lot of sense. She believes that Ray died because he showed his ID to Kira. So of course she did.  be careful not to reveal her own identity. Oh, this isn't good. It's gonna be almost impossible to ask for her real name knowing she gave me an alias the first time. If I'm too persistent, she'll get suspicious. What am I saying? It looks suspicious that I even knew she was using an alias. I should probably be getting back soon. Someone from the task force might be back there by now. Oh, yeah. You could be right. Let's cross our fingers and hope someone's there.  Yeah. Damn it. I'm running out of options here. I have to stop this before it's too late. Oh no. What if my father calls back now? I already promised her that I'd let her talk to him if he did. If this phone rings, it's all over for me. What am I going to do? This is crazy. All I have to do is turn it off.  my cell phone off. Problem solved. Now, calm down. You know what needs to be done. Just find out her real name. Her purse. Her pockets. She's got to have a driver's license or some kind of personal identification on her somewhere. She's a woman, after all. I suppose if I had to, I could use force. No. No, the last thing I want to do is make a scene in public. I've got to get her somewhere isolated. But where? And what explanation could I give her? I would never  work. She's too careful. I need a better approach. I can do this. I'm going to convince her to give me her real name. Hey, Light, you know, that deal I mentioned is still open. It's just like putting on contact lenses. Completely painless. Would I be willing to give up half my life just so I could learn this woman's real name? No, I wouldn't. In fact, it's not even worth considering. Now, quit wasting my time.  Just shut your mouth, Shinigami! Excuse me. Yes? Do you still have business at the police station, then? I'd like to go there by myself, if you don't mind. Yeah, no problem. Our names and ranks are false. Why did you give us fake IDs? As you know, Kira requires a name and a face to kill. We will confront him with that premise in mind, and I think it should be obvious why. Yes, but of all people that...  the police shouldn't use fake IDs. Enough. What choice do we really have given the capabilities of our enemy? As long as you're working on this case, I think we're going to need all the protection one can get. It would be foolish not to use them. Yeah, you got a good point. Uh-huh. Remember, anytime you're in a situation where you have to give out your name to a stranger, make sure to use the name from your fake ID, understood? Right. And be careful not to take them out while in the presence of other police officers. I'm sure I don't need to tell you. That could cause problems for us.  I understand. Very well, then. I'd like to request that you wear these at all times. Uh, belts? Each one has a transmitter hidden in the buckle. This will allow Ryozaki to monitor your whereabouts. And when you press the buckle twice like this, my cell phone will ring, displaying your name. And I'll call you back immediately, but you won't see my number displayed. In the morning, all of you will go to the police station as you speak.  usual then later on in the day we'll use this method to confirm the name of Ryuzaki's hotel and his room number please use this for emergencies as well no way this is totally cool I feel like some kind of secret agent going after Kira quiet Matsuda this is not the time to be fooling around knock it off yes sir thank you so much for everything you've done light after talking to you I feel much more confident about my theory not at all  Considering that Ryuk mentioned that ideal again, there's no doubt in my mind that she used an alias. At this rate, once she goes to the police with her theory about Kira being on that bus, and they look at all the people Ray Pembro was investigating, it won't take them long to zero in on me. Hey, she's leaving. So now what? I've got about five minutes before that woman gets to police headquarters.  headquarters. Think, I need her real name, and I don't have much time to spare. If this woman makes it to the police station and someone from the task force has returned by then, it'll all be over for me. I've got to find out her real name, then eliminate her quickly. Only three minutes.  until she reaches the station. Alright. Uh-oh. Whatcha doin'? Excuse me. Yes? There's something that I should probably tell you. Okay. The thing is, it'll be impossible for you to contact anyone from the task force directly. Huh? That's right. Keep the conversation going. I just need to find something that she can latch onto, and I've got her. When she's comfortable, then I can get her real name. I can do that.  I can't contact anyone, but why not? Didn't you find it odd that there was no one at Task Force Headquarters? Uh, yeah. I did find it a bit strange, but I didn't... Let me explain. The Task Force has been organized so that its members can't be identified and nobody on the outside knows who's in charge. If the members' names were ever made public, or the structure of the Task Force was revealed, we'd likely see another tragedy along the lines of the one that claimed your fianc\u00e9's life.  I see. That's why you were told earlier that no one was at Task Force headquarters. What I'm trying to say is, you'll never be able to talk to someone directly from the Task Force because the police simply won't allow it. That's pretty clever. I'm impressed. If this is supposed to be a secret, then how do you know so much? Guess I spoke too soon, She's Sharp.  Very well. You leave me no choice. It's because I'm actually a member of the task force. I'm sorry, you're telling me that you're an agent? Yes. L is currently in charge of the task force, and he's leading our investigation. Yes. To be honest, I already suspected that. He was concerned that the task force had become too small. Many detectives had quit fearing for their lives, and so... Despite the fact that I'm a high school student, he brought me on board to help out with the investigation.  After all, I've helped them solve cases in the past. So, L trusts you, then? I can go to task force headquarters whenever it suits me, and I'm allowed to investigate freely as I see fit. You see, these days the task force is made up of a chosen few, an elite group of people handpicked for the job by L. All are highly skilled, well-respected, and above all, trustworthy.  Thanks for explaining, but just to be safe, I'd like to try and visit the task force headquarters again. Uh-huh. Goodbye. Bye. Please, wait a second. It's like I just told you, they won't let you talk to anyone. I know, but I was hoping I could speak with Elle directly. Goodbye. Oh, and come to think of it, who...  Who's at the police station right now? Actually, no one's there at the moment. That's not good news. We need someone there at all times. Work in shifts if you have to. I understand. Aizawa, I'll put you in charge of that for today. Yes, sir. I'm on my way. Won't take me long. Ms. Maki, please, wait a second. It's literally impossible to meet L. This is pointless. You may be right, but I think that there's a chance that he'll meet with me. Uh-huh.  Although the only contact I've had with him was following orders through a computer, he might remember who I am. You see, I worked under him in a case in the U.S. about two years ago. Are you serious? You worked under L? Yes. I didn't tell you this, but up until three months ago, I worked as an FBI agent. This is it. Finally something I can use. Guess I shouldn't be surprised. In fact, I noticed early on that your investigative skills were far beyond those of an amateur. You're right.  You're very cautious, and you seem to have a gift for getting to the heart of the matter. If I could, I'd like to learn from you. One lie after another, you make it look easy. From the beginning, I knew I had to do things outside the regular channels, because from my perspective, both the police and the members of the task force were suspects. But I'm certain that I can trust Elle. Maybe it's unrealistic, but I think that if I go to headquarters and I give them my name, there's a chance that they'll let me speak with him.  directly. I see. But if the only person you could trust with this info was L, then why me? I suppose I was upset that they wouldn't allow me to see anyone from the task force, and then you came along, claiming to be the son of the lead detective, and... No, that's not it. I'll be honest with you. It's because you remind me of L. There's something about you that's just like him. Hmm.  Will you investigate this case with me? Huh? I want you to come work with us as part of the task force. We could use your help. As I'm sure you know, not just anyone can do it. Please. I know this is sudden, but the team needs people like you. I'm serious. You could be doing so much more than gathering information on your own. You have all the experience as an FBI agent. You're more talented than most of the detectives currently...  on the task force and L obviously trusted you in the past. It wouldn't be that difficult for you to join. All you'd need is some valid identification, a recommendation from a current task force member, and of course you need to get L's permission. You want me to join the task force? I can't help but think that it must be fate that I met you today. I'd like to be the one to recommend you. Oh, I'm sorry about that. I guess I got a little bit too excited. It's okay.  I mean, even if you acted as a consultant on this investigation, it would be a great help. I'm sure you have personal obligations to attend to, not to mention the fact that you live in the United States. It's true. Before all this happened, I thought I'd continue living in America with my fianc\u00e9. We planned on getting married in the spring. But now he's gone, so I'm not sure what to do anymore. All right, I've come this far. All she needs is a little encouragement. But you're young and beautiful, and you've got your life ahead of you. Why put it all in danger for you?  for this no now that Ray's gone I've got nothing to lose anymore I want to catch Kira I don't care about anything else it's all I want to do please let me investigate this case with you yes of course I just need to see some form of identification before we proceed oh yes you see the name I gave you earlier well I  It wasn't actually my real name. I'm so sorry. Don't worry, it's all right. To be honest, I'm impressed by how incredibly thorough you've been. You've stayed one step ahead of me. But I suppose that's just further proof of your capabilities. So will a Japanese driver's license do the trick, then? Sure.  I made it in time. So, if you don't mind my asking, why do you  I keep checking your watch. Oh, well... I guess it's because... Because I'm Kira.  What's the matter? There's something I have to do. My father's cell phone might be available now. Do you want to see if you can talk to him? No, thank you. I have nothing to say to him.  Then goodbye, Naomi Misura. \u5922\u3092\u898b\u3066 \u8981\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3082\u306e\u306f\u5168\u3066\u6368\u3066\u305f\u8b72\u308c\u306a\u3044\u60f3\u3044 \u3053\u306e\u80f8\u306b\u3042\u3063\u305f\u307e\u3060 \u898b\u3048\u308b\u610f\u5916\u3042\u308b\u306e\u304b \u69d8\u306b\u304b\u72a0\u7272\u306e\u98a8\u306b\u8db3\u3092\u53d6\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3082 \u6ea2\u308c\u308b\u60f3\u3044 \u3054\u8996\u8074\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f  With Ryuk's information and my preparations, I can continue to kill criminals while masquerading as a typical high school student studying for his entrance exams.

I'd like to request that you wear these at all times. Uh, belts? Each one has a transmitter hidden in the buckle. This will allow Ryozaki to monitor your whereabouts. And when you press the buckle twice like this, my cell phone will ring, displaying your name. And I'll call you back immediately, but you won't see my number displayed. In the morning, all of you will go to the police station as you speak. usual then later on in the day we'll use this method to confirm the name of Ryuzaki's hotel and his room number please use this for emergencies as well no way this is totally cool I feel like some kind of secret agent going after Kira quiet Matsuda this is not the time to be fooling around knock it off yes sir thank you so much for everything you've done light after talking to you I feel much more confident about my theory not at all Considering that Ryuk mentioned that ideal again, there's no doubt in my mind that she used an alias. At this rate, once she goes to the police with her theory about Kira being on that bus, and they look at all the people Ray Pembro was investigating, it won't take them long to zero in on me. Hey, she's leaving. So now what? I've got about five minutes before that woman gets to police headquarters. headquarters. Think, I need her real name, and I don't have much time to spare. If this woman makes it to the police station and someone from the task force has returned by then, it'll all be over for me. I've got to find out her real name, then eliminate her quickly. Only three minutes. until she reaches the station. Alright. Uh-oh. Whatcha doin'? Excuse me. Yes? There's something that I should probably tell you. Okay. The thing is, it'll be impossible for you to contact anyone from the task force directly. Huh? That's right. Keep the conversation going. I just need to find something that she can latch onto, and I've got her. When she's comfortable, then I can get her real name. I can do that. I can't contact anyone, but why not? Didn't you find it odd that there was no one at Task Force Headquarters? Uh, yeah. I did find it a bit strange, but I didn't... Let me explain. The Task Force has been organized so that its members can't be identified and nobody on the outside knows who's in charge. If the members' names were ever made public, or the structure of the Task Force was revealed, we'd likely see another tragedy along the lines of the one that claimed your fianc\u00e9's life. I see. That's why you were told earlier that no one was at Task Force headquarters. What I'm trying to say is, you'll never be able to talk to someone directly from the Task Force because the police simply won't allow it. That's pretty clever. I'm impressed. If this is supposed to be a secret, then how do you know so much? Guess I spoke too soon, She's Sharp. Very well. You leave me no choice. It's because I'm actually a member of the task force. I'm sorry, you're telling me that you're an agent? Yes. L is currently in charge of the task force, and he's leading our investigation. Yes. To be honest, I already suspected that. He was concerned that the task force had become too small. Many detectives had quit fearing for their lives, and so... Despite the fact that I'm a high school student, he brought me on board to help out with the investigation. After all, I've helped them solve cases in the past. So, L trusts you, then? I can go to task force headquarters whenever it suits me, and I'm allowed to investigate freely as I see fit. You see, these days the task force is made up of a chosen few, an elite group of people handpicked for the job by L. All are highly skilled, well-respected, and above all, trustworthy. Thanks for explaining, but just to be safe, I'd like to try and visit the task force headquarters again. Uh-huh. Goodbye. Bye. Please, wait a second. It's like I just told you, they won't let you talk to anyone. I know, but I was hoping I could speak with Elle directly. Goodbye. Oh, and come to think of it, who... Who's at the police station right now? Actually, no one's there at the moment. That's not good news. We need someone there at all times. Work in shifts if you have to. I understand. Aizawa, I'll put you in charge of that for today. Yes, sir. I'm on my way. Won't take me long. Ms. Maki, please, wait a second. It's literally impossible to meet L. This is pointless. You may be right, but I think that there's a chance that he'll meet with me. Uh-huh. Although the only contact I've had with him was following orders through a computer, he might remember who I am. You see, I worked under him in a case in the U.S. about two years ago. Are you serious? You worked under L? Yes. I didn't tell you this, but up until three months ago, I worked as an FBI agent. This is it. Finally something I can use. Guess I shouldn't be surprised. In fact, I noticed early on that your investigative skills were far beyond those of an amateur. You're right. You're very cautious, and you seem to have a gift for getting to the heart of the matter. If I could, I'd like to learn from you. One lie after another, you make it look easy. From the beginning, I knew I had to do things outside the regular channels, because from my perspective, both the police and the members of the task force were suspects. But I'm certain that I can trust Elle. Maybe it's unrealistic, but I think that if I go to headquarters and I give them my name, there's a chance that they'll let me speak with him. directly. I see. But if the only person you could trust with this info was L, then why me? I suppose I was upset that they wouldn't allow me to see anyone from the task force, and then you came along, claiming to be the son of the lead detective, and... No, that's not it. I'll be honest with you. It's because you remind me of L. There's something about you that's just like him. Hmm. Will you investigate this case with me? Huh? I want you to come work with us as part of the task force. We could use your help. As I'm sure you know, not just anyone can do it. Please. I know this is sudden, but the team needs people like you. I'm serious. You could be doing so much more than gathering information on your own. You have all the experience as an FBI agent. You're more talented than most of the detectives currently... on the task force and L obviously trusted you in the past. It wouldn't be that difficult for you to join. All you'd need is some valid identification, a recommendation from a current task force member, and of course you need to get L's permission. You want me to join the task force? I can't help but think that it must be fate that I met you today. I'd like to be the one to recommend you. Oh, I'm sorry about that. I guess I got a little bit too excited. It's okay. I mean, even if you acted as a consultant on this investigation, it would be a great help. I'm sure you have personal obligations to attend to, not to mention the fact that you live in the United States. It's true. Before all this happened, I thought I'd continue living in America with my fianc\u00e9. We planned on getting married in the spring. But now he's gone, so I'm not sure what to do anymore. All right, I've come this far. All she needs is a little encouragement. But you're young and beautiful, and you've got your life ahead of you. Why put it all in danger for you? for this no now that Ray's gone I've got nothing to lose anymore I want to catch Kira I don't care about anything else it's all I want to do please let me investigate this case with you yes of course I just need to see some form of identification before we proceed oh yes you see the name I gave you earlier well I It wasn't actually my real name. I'm so sorry. Don't worry, it's all right. To be honest, I'm impressed by how incredibly thorough you've been. You've stayed one step ahead of me. But I suppose that's just further proof of your capabilities. So will a Japanese driver's license do the trick, then? Sure. I made it in time. So, if you don't mind my asking, why do you I keep checking your watch. Oh, well... I guess it's because... Because I'm Kira. What's the matter? There's something I have to do. My father's cell phone might be available now. Do you want to see if you can talk to him? No, thank you. I have nothing to say to him. Then goodbye, Naomi Misura. I dreamed, and threw away everything I didn't need. I had feelings in my heart that I couldn't give up. Is there something else I can still see? Even if the wind of sacrifice takes my feet away, my feelings overflow. Thank you for watching With Ryuk's information and my preparations, I can continue to kill criminals while masquerading as a typical high school student studying for his entrance exams. Just watch me, El."

Listen for the voice of God.  then follow it and know that in time you will find your salvation. You're wrong. He just totally snapped. Really? Is that what you said? Yagami, are you still with us? Can you please translate the following sentence into English? Wow. This is amazing. Follow the teachings of God and receive His blessings, and so it shall be that the seas will again become bountiful and the raging storms will subside. Today at approximately 11 a.m., a 32-year-old  man was found stabbed to death in his apartment in the city of Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture. Kanagawa police are treating this case as homicide. In other news, today's suspected murderer Naoki Kofuji was arrested in the district of Shibuya, Tokyo. He is being held in custody facing murder charges for the brutal slaying of his common law partner, who was only 25 at the time of her death. Day in and day out, the same news on permanent...  Pete, this is all so ridiculous. This world is rotting. Another noticeable consequence is the extinction of many species on the planet. Species are now becoming extinct at a faster rate than has ever occurred in our recorded history.  I love you.  Death Note? As in a notebook of death? How do you use it? The human whose name is written in this notebook shall die. That's pretty lame. Not to mention twisted. It's really not that different from one of those chain letters you get. The human whose name is written in this notebook shall die? Come on.  There must be something wrong with me to even consider it. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his or her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected. If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.  If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds. Hmm. So depending on the person you have in mind, you can either kill them easily or painfully, huh? This is pretty detailed for a prank, I'll give them that. Hmm. So I write a name in that person's name.  dies. Like anyone would believe that. Wait. On the off chance someone really dies, would that make me a murderer? Yeah, right. It's completely impossible.  The same assailant who attacked six people at a busy shopping district in Shinjuku yesterday has struck again, taking eight people hostage at this daycare center. His captives include both children and teachers. The police have now identified the suspect as 42-year-old Kuro Otoharada, currently unemployed. We expect negotiations to begin immediately. A heart attack in 40 seconds? We'll see. At the present time, that's all the police are telling us.  You can't help but feel concerned for the safety of those hostages. You're absolutely right. We'll continue to monitor the situation from here. Thank you for that report. What do you make of this, Mr. Hashimoto? Well, one can only hope for a quick resolution to this situation. Looks like the notebook doesn't work. Oh well, I didn't expect it to anyway. Wait, we're seeing something here. Looks like movement at the front entrance. The hostages are coming out, and they all look to be unharmed.  The special forces are taking action. They're moving in. We don't know if the suspect's been arrested. Huh? Yes? Okay, we now have confirmation. The suspect has been found dead inside. I repeat, the suspect is now dead. Dead? Dead? The special forces are denying allegations that they shot the suspect. So it's quite possible he was feeling cornered and decided to commit suicide? Well, according to statements from the hostages, the suspect just suddenly collapsed. A heart attack?  No way. It's coincidence. This has to be a coincidence. Bye. It's already 6.30, you know. Don't you have cram school tonight? Yeah, I'll be ready in just a sec. Death note. It's unlikely, but if by chance this thing is for real, I have to test it one more time. In which case, it should probably be another criminal. But if he's too well known, that's...  That'll be a problem. If he dies, there's a good possibility the news of his death will be covered up. I need to see results right away. Hey, real buddy. What is it, Sudo? Didn't you want to lend me $20? What? Again? But I can't do that. Sudo. Maybe I should try killing him. No. I should definitely avoid killing people I know. Then again, does it even really matter? I mean, would anyone really care if a guy like you  like him was to disappear one day? Sweet! Looks like we'll be hanging at the arcade after school. Hey, Austin, we're having a speed dating party tomorrow. You want to come? Yeah, of course! Oh, there's no way I'm missing that. Damn it! Why is my mom so useless? She's never here to pick me up on time! Once you actually start looking around, it makes you wonder if you'd be doing society a favor by getting rid of all these people. Hey, baby!  Where are you going? Come have a little fun with us. That's our Taku for you. This guy could spot Hadi a mile away. What's up, little lady? The name's Tako Shibuimaru. What do you say? Come hang out with us, pretty lady. Please, I don't want any trouble. You hear that? She doesn't want trouble. Isn't that cute? Let's go, boys. Strip her down right here. Are you sure? No! Stop!  Please! Help me! Now, what will happen? No! No! Hey! Wait up! Don't look out! No! No! No! No! No! That settles it. The Death Note. It's for real. Oh, man!  Sakulo! Stupid kid! He just came out of nowhere! Now then, I better get going. It's been five days. Now then, I better get going.  You headed somewhere, Ryuk? Hate to tell you, but our whole world looks like this. That's true, but I've dropped my death note. You really messed things up, didn't you? Hold on a sec. Didn't you already trick the old man to get a second book? Don't tell me you dropped both of them. You must have some idea where you dropped the thing. Yeah. The human world. What?  Oh, my God.  Hi, Mom. It's because... Oh, the results of the nationwide exams. I've been waiting all day. Here. Goodness! Number one again! These are the highest scores you've had. Yeah, I guess. I'm going to study in my room, so please don't interrupt me, okay? As you wish. Oh, Light. Do you want anything at all, dear? You can ask for whatever you like. No, I'm fine, Mom. Thanks, though.  I've already got what I want. You've taken quite a liking to it.  No reason to act surprised. I am the Shinigami Ryuk. That used to be my notebook. Judging by your laughter, you've already figured out that what you have is no ordinary notebook. Shinigami. A god of death, huh? Well, I'm not surprised. In fact...  Ryuk, I've been waiting... for you. Oh? I've already figured out that this Death Note I found is real. It didn't take me long. And now that I've witnessed the proof of its power, I only feel more confident in what I'm gonna do. That's interesting. I certainly wasn't expecting this. Several Death Notes have made their way into the human world in the past, but you're the first to have written this many names. Look at him.  How many people you've killed in only five days? Most are reluctant to write this much. I've already prepared myself, Ryuk. I used the notebook even though I knew it belonged to a Shinigami. And now that Shinigami has come. So what'll happen to me? You're here to take my soul, right? Huh? What do you mean? Is that some fantasy you humans came up with? I'm not gonna do anything to you. The notebook becomes part of the human realm from the very beginning.  moment it touches the earth. In other words, the notebook is now yours. This is mine? If you don't want it, just give it to someone else. But if you give it away, I'd have no choice but to erase your memories of the notebook. So then, you're saying I can use the Death Note all I want and I won't be punished? Let's just say this. You will feel the fear and pain known only to humans who've used the notebook. And when it's your time to die...  it will fall on me to write your name in my death note. Be warned, any human who's used a death note can neither go to heaven nor hell for eternity. That's all. Now you have something to look forward to after you die. Light? It'll be all right. Answer it.  What is it? I thought you'd like some apples. The neighbors brought them over for us. Why on earth is it so dark in your room? You ruin your eyesight. What's going on? Mom can't see him? That notebook you found originally belonged to me. And since you're now using it, you are the only one who's able to see me. And of course, my voice can only be heard by you. In other words, the Death Note is the bomb.  between Light, the human, and Ryuk, the Shinigami. Yum. I just have one more question I want to ask you. Why was I chosen for this? Hey, are you even listening? Apples in the human world are worth the trip. What's the best way to describe these? You see? Just answer my question. I didn't choose you. Don't you see this?  This is all just an accident. You actually thought you were chosen because you're so smart or something? Don't be so vain. It just happened to fall around here and you just happened to pick it up. And that's all there is to it. That's why I wrote the instructions in English, the most popular language in the human world. Then why did you drop it in the first place? You even wrote down specific instructions. So don't try to tell me this was an accident. You're asking me why? I did it because I was bored. Why?  You were bored? The truth is, Shinigami haven't got much to do these days. Most of the time we're either taking naps or gambling. If you take the time to write names in your death note, the others just laugh at you for working so hard. Even if you wrote the name of another Shinigami, it'd be pointless because they wouldn't die. And since we live in the Shinigami realm, it brings us no amusement to kill those in the human world either. So I figured I'd have more fun if I came down here.  myself. Anyway, I'm surprised at how many names you've written. But I want to know why you only wrote the cause of death for that guy who was hit by the truck. If you don't write down the cause of death, the victim dies of a heart attack. And that's probably the best thing about the death note, Ryuk. You see, I've already exhausted the list of the world's major criminals, and eventually I'm gonna get rid of them all. What's the point of doing that? It's only a matter of time before people figure out  out that these criminals are being eliminated by someone. I want the world to know of my existence, that there's someone out there passing righteous judgment on the wicked. Why even bother? What are you trying to achieve by passing judgment on them? I mean, why do you care? Because I've been bored too. I wasn't ready to believe it at first, but it's obvious now. There's something about the death note.  itself that makes humans want to try it out at least once. I killed them both. I really... I killed two men. Those were human lives. It won't be overlooked. Besides, who am I to pass judgment on others? No, no, wait. Maybe I'm wrong. This is exactly what I've been thinking about lately. This world is rotting, and those who are making it  Rot deserved to die. Someone has to do it, so why not me? Even if it means sacrificing my own mind and soul, it's worth it. Because the world can't go on like this. I wonder, what if someone else had picked up this notebook? Is there anyone out there other than me who'd be willing to eliminate the vermin from the world? If I don't do it, then who will? That's just it, there's no one. But I can do it. In fact, I'm...  I'm the only one who can. I'll do it. Using the Death Note, I'll change the world.  At first, I wrote the names of the worst criminals I could think of, like I was cleaning up the world one name at a time, so that eventually no one will ever do anything evil again. And while the truly guilty ones who deserve to be punished for their crimes die of heart attacks, the people who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones  who are less guilty but who still make trouble for others, will slowly be erased through disease and accidental death. Then, and only then, the world will start moving in the right direction. It'll be a new world, free of injustice and populated by people who I've judged to be honest, kind, and hardworking. But if you did that, it would make you the only bad person left. Huh? I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm a hardworking honor student who's considered to be one of Japan's best and brightest.  And I... I will become the god of this new world. It's just as I thought. Humans are so interesting. memememememememememe \u3054\u8996\u8074\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f  I'll show the world what happens when you try to cross me The entire world is watching now El",

So then, you're saying I can use the Death Note all I want and I won't be punished? Let's just say this. You will feel the fear and pain known only to humans who've used the notebook. And when it's your time to die... it will fall on me to write your name in my death note. Be warned, any human who's used a death note can neither go to heaven nor hell for eternity. That's all. Now you have something to look forward to after you die. Light? It'll be all right. Answer it. What is it? I thought you'd like some apples. The neighbors brought them over for us. Why on earth is it so dark in your room? You ruin your eyesight. What's going on? Mom can't see him? That notebook you found originally belonged to me. And since you're now using it, you are the only one who's able to see me. And of course, my voice can only be heard by you. In other words, the Death Note is the bomb. between Light, the human, and Ryuk, the Shinigami. Yum. I just have one more question I want to ask you. Why was I chosen for this? Hey, are you even listening? Apples in the human world are worth the trip. What's the best way to describe these? You see? Just answer my question. I didn't choose you. Don't you see this? This is all just an accident. You actually thought you were chosen because you're so smart or something? Don't be so vain. It just happened to fall around here and you just happened to pick it up. And that's all there is to it. That's why I wrote the instructions in English, the most popular language in the human world. Then why did you drop it in the first place? You even wrote down specific instructions. So don't try to tell me this was an accident. You're asking me why? I did it because I was bored. Why? You were bored? The truth is, Shinigami haven't got much to do these days. Most of the time we're either taking naps or gambling. If you take the time to write names in your death note, the others just laugh at you for working so hard. Even if you wrote the name of another Shinigami, it'd be pointless because they wouldn't die. And since we live in the Shinigami realm, it brings us no amusement to kill those in the human world either. So I figured I'd have more fun if I came down here. myself. Anyway, I'm surprised at how many names you've written. But I want to know why you only wrote the cause of death for that guy who was hit by the truck. If you don't write down the cause of death, the victim dies of a heart attack. And that's probably the best thing about the death note, Ryuk. You see, I've already exhausted the list of the world's major criminals, and eventually I'm gonna get rid of them all. What's the point of doing that? It's only a matter of time before people figure out out that these criminals are being eliminated by someone. I want the world to know of my existence, that there's someone out there passing righteous judgment on the wicked. Why even bother? What are you trying to achieve by passing judgment on them? I mean, why do you care? Because I've been bored too. I wasn't ready to believe it at first, but it's obvious now. There's something about the death note. itself that makes humans want to try it out at least once. I killed them both. I really... I killed two men. Those were human lives. It won't be overlooked. Besides, who am I to pass judgment on others? No, no, wait. Maybe I'm wrong. This is exactly what I've been thinking about lately. This world is rotting, and those who are making it Rot deserved to die. Someone has to do it, so why not me? Even if it means sacrificing my own mind and soul, it's worth it. Because the world can't go on like this. I wonder, what if someone else had picked up this notebook? Is there anyone out there other than me who'd be willing to eliminate the vermin from the world? If I don't do it, then who will? That's just it, there's no one. But I can do it. In fact, I'm... I'm the only one who can. I'll do it. Using the Death Note, I'll change the world. At first, I wrote the names of the worst criminals I could think of, like I was cleaning up the world one name at a time, so that eventually no one will ever do anything evil again. And while the truly guilty ones who deserve to be punished for their crimes die of heart attacks, the people who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are less guilty but who still make trouble for others, will slowly be erased through disease and accidental death. Then, and only then, the world will start moving in the right direction. It'll be a new world, free of injustice and populated by people who I've judged to be honest, kind, and hardworking. But if you did that, it would make you the only bad person left. Huh? I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm a hardworking honor student who's considered to be one of Japan's best and brightest. And I... I will become the god of this new world. It's just as I thought. Humans are so interesting. samememememememememe Thank you for watching I'll show the world what happens when you try to cross me The entire world is watching now El"

        "original": " Once upon a time, you see, in a strange land not far away, I met for chance a little bee, upon a most unusual day. And when I asked who she was, she told me, Maya, no other bee could be as beautiful as you.  could ever be like Maya. Maya, why you question me? Why is no, no answer for a bee? My, my, she's always in a pretty pickle. Maya, helping someone else's little Maya. Maya, everyone loves Maya. Maya.  Maya, Maya, Maya, come tell us what you see. Just to think of boxing.  That's Maya coming to see us. Ah! Ah! Whoop! Oh! Oh! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Hey, more careful, please. What are you doing? Hang on a sec. And... Ah! Ah! Ha ha ha! Oh! Oh! Oh! Ouch!  Oh, there's Alexander. Well, how are you, Alexander? So-so, I guess. Oh, I see you have another piece of cheese. Yes, and you can smell how good it is. Well, I must be going. Goodness, what a painful business. Lately everything has seen such an effort. I hope he's not sick. He's not getting any younger.  Oh, oh, Mr. Turtle, how are you? Oh, it's you, Maya. Hello. I'm fine, thanks. Hello, Maya. Isn't it a beautiful day? Yes, Flip, it's lovely. He helps well. Quickly, Mr. Turtle, help him, please. I'm coming, I'm coming. Here goes. Help, help, help. There you are.  I was close. I'm glad I could help you. Without your help, I would surely have drowned. Those were very big jumps. I don't think so. I've always managed them before. I wonder if I'm getting old. It could be arthritis. Oh, these old bones, they don't work so well anymore. Hello, Frida. I've been looking for you everywhere. At last.  What do you mean? I'm Maya. What's that I see? Buck and Maya? Hey, hey, hey. What's this all about? Huh? Oh, forgive me, my darlingest. My eyes are getting worse and worse. I mixed you up with Maya. I know that you're short-sighted, but to do something like this to me, no, really. Oh,  Oh, Freda, please, there's no reason to start crying. You know, I very nearly lost my life today through my short-sightedness. I only just managed to escape.  The fly-sorto missed me by a hair's breadth. Ah! Ah! That's been my nightmare for years. Just think when he's usually so fast. Oh! I've got the feeling my hearing's getting worse. I can't hear the high notes at all anymore. Terrible! That would be... Do you realise she's also out of tune? Gracious, what could be worse than a violin virtuoso who's such a...  I can't believe I'm losing her hearing. One of them can't jump and the others are losing their sight and hearing. Just wait for me, Baba. No, no, no! Just wait for me. No! First you must tell me what you want.  I'll tell you something, my darling. You must stop chasing me like this. My heart won't take it. Strange. I'm also completely out of breath. Oh, dear. I hope it's not old age creeping up on us, Kurt. I fear it may be. For weeks now when I work, I feel a stabbing here in my shoulder. Oh, dear. Assuage my shoulder for me a bit. Yes.  Yes, of course. So now I'll make a good herb tea for the tourists. Ah, that was nice. Come, I'll do it for you too. Hmm, you do that well. Ah, seems as if everybody's sick. Oh no, wrinkles! Oh, I can't believe it!  I won't believe it. I won't believe it. What's the matter, this butterfly? Have you hurt yourself? I have to do something about it once. I'm terrible. I must ask her again. Perhaps she's really sick. Please tell me, don't you feel very well? What? Oh! I'm just putting on my beauty mask. I'm sorry. I hope I didn't frighten you. You're doing what?  discovered wrinkles on my face. This is a mixture of honey and sunflower seed oil. That'll get rid of wrinkles? Of course it will. It's a famous old remedy. Explain to me, do wrinkles hurt you? What a silly question. When you've given your life to beauty as I have, they can hurt you most terribly. Would you like to try some? Oh, no. Oh, yes. I had the same confidence as you have just a couple of years ago. But you lose that as soon as you lose your beauty. Please.  Believe me. It's really most odd. Suddenly all my friends are worried that they're beginning to get old. And I can see it. They can't do the things they used to be able to do.   Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  Oh, yes, that's right. Not so fast, Flip. I can't fly as well as I could. What do you mean? For someone your age, you still fly extremely well. Here, it's easier if we help each other. Ah, here at last. What do you want?  Oh, it's Flip, if I'm not mistaken. Quite right, quite right. What's that? Who did you buy? I said quite right! Ah-ha! And who's this we've got here? Madam Butterfly, how nice of you to visit. HE LAUGHS Would you like another cup of tea? No, thank you. I can't understand how in my young days I didn't like to eat cheese at all. Just so's how choosy the young people are. You please don't feel obliged.  No, nice and soft. Just right for my poor old teeth. By the way, Miss Thekla, wouldn't you like to play a little something for us while we eat? Miss Thekla? Oh, dear poor Alexander. He can't see very well or hear very well anymore. Only eat cheese. There's Maya over there. Maya! Oh, of course. Now I remember. Maya can't play anymore because she's got rheumatism. It's pointless explaining to him. We all of us know that we're getting old, but he's totally gaga. What's that? You want some gorgonzola? I don't have any in this mislob.  until the autumn festival, huh? I'm not so interested in eating up all my good food. It's such a pity about poor old Alexander. We're still a couple of spring chickens compared to him. Once upon a time, that's how all fairy tales start. Where are the days when we were still young, Maya? Now be careful not to strain yourself. You're old enough.  Oh, as long as I can still fly, Flip, life is not so bad. Oh, oh, oh, I can't stay up. I'm dropping lower and lower. Oh! Why don't you watch out? You're blocking the road. You could at least apologize. And who are you, anyway? I don't recognize you. What's that? You don't know us anymore? You're a very old... That's true, but surely you should recognize us. They're the three ladybird children. Can you really not remember us, Maya?  Yes, I do. Well, sort of. Think back. Well, of course, now I remember. You must be the three ladybird children. But goodness, you're so big. Well, we're old enough, aren't we? We've grown big and you've grown old. That's the only difference. Now, you listen to me. Even if you have grown up, you've still got absolutely no right to call me an old bee. Do you understand? Aha, that's how I remember her. She was always fighting. She really has got very old.  You can put her down now. Have a look in the water. Can you see what an old bag of bones you've turned into? What's going on? How can you be so small? You were giants. At least twice as tall as I am. Let's see if we can wake her up.  Whether you're big or small, you're always causing trouble. Oh! Oh, I dreamed that.  Good, I was right. It was just a nasty dream. I'm not an ugly old bee. And I can still fly perfectly. My wings are as good as ever. Hello, Maya. Would you like to dance? Yes.  I'm so glad that was a dream. I can fly as well as ever and that's never going to change. And that I know for absolute certain. At least I don't notice my getting old. Oh!  Oh, Dr. Snail. I see you're in a good mood as usual. Oh, yes. But please excuse me for sitting on your house. That's all right. I was just having a good think about something that's been bothering me a lot, so I went into my shell. I'm worried about the health of our insects. Dr. Snail, Dr. Snail. We're calling Dr. Snail. Yes, yes, Snail, Dr. Snail. What is it? Alexander the Great has suffered a great misfortune. Really? Oh, please, Dr. Snail, won't you go and see him? Very well. Careful, Carly, he's rolling down.  Come on, have a good trip. Why do I always get into trouble? This is no time for foolishness. Alexander, what's the matter? It happened when I wanted to pick up my cheese. All of a sudden I experienced always terrible pain in my hip.  Possibly a hernia. Lift him up carefully and put him down over there. Hopefully we won't have to operate on you, if we're lucky, that is. Would you believe it? He picks up a piece of cheese and gives himself a hernia. I'll have to do a thorough examination. You remember what I was saying, Maya? For some time now I've been scratching my head about the health of a lot of insects around here. Why not examine everyone? I'll go and call them. Very good, we will check.  We'll take it upon ourselves to instruct everybody to come here. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Today's examinations have borne out what I suspected, which is that the physical condition of most of you leaves a lot to be desired. If you don't do something about it, you'll all end up as old crocs. You see, that's where the pain in your shoulder comes from. Could I be old already?  It's terrible. Now, everyone listen here. As from today and three times a day, you will all do physical exercises to slow down the process of growing old. As you know, physical exercise is the best way to do that. That's a good idea. I'll begin with some stomach exercises so that I can eat much more pollen. You'll definitely come to a bad end. If you carry on like that, one day you'll fall out of the air because your wings won't be able to support you. I hope that'll make you think, Willie. To tell the truth, it won't. It'll still be...  It'll be a long time before I'm too heavy to fly. That's no reason for not doing a bit of training. I won't have to train, will I? Oh, yes, you will. It's never too early to start, my dear Maya. Ah, I think you're right. When I think of what happened, perhaps I've become too fat and slow to get out of the way in time. We'll start right away with the exercises. An easy one to begin with. First we run as fast as we can, and then...  Every four or five steps we jump into the air like rabbits. Any questions? That sounds too terrible. Do you think we'll manage? I'll practice in my web. Run and jump, must we? No, Doctor, it's too difficult. No, Doctor, it's too difficult.  All right, then. Forget it. And in a few months, you'll all be crippled and lame. Help! Help! A fire! Fire! Somebody's house is on fire! Where's the fire? Where's the fire? Look, you can see the smoke. I'll tell you where the fire is. Alexander, it's your own house that's going up in flames. What? You're saying my house is on fire? My house is on fire? Doctor, we can't do any training today. We must go and put Alexander's fire out. That is good training. I don't know if I...  I can't help with my body out of condition like this. Enough of your silly jokes, there's no time for that. Everybody down to the stream and fill buckets. Make a long chain to Alexander's house and toss them along. Help Alexander! It's terrible! Fire out! Fire out! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!  In such cases, I'm very useful. My valuable staff! My treasure!  This is a good opportunity to give a demonstration of my  aerobatic flying. I went not too far into the flames. Don't stop now, everyone. The fire's nearly out.  Oh, I'm afraid we've arrived too late. The fire's out. Yes, sir. The fire is out. My friends, how on earth am I going to thank you? You're not going to thank me.  Thank you for us if I didn't spread any further. Anyone on his own would have been helpless against that inferno. That's true. It shows we should all stick together. I'm always here, always on duty. Anyone can ask me for help any time. It's such a pity that the heat warped the bow of my violin. Can you stop showing off like that? Ow! And how's your hip doing, if I may ask? Good heavens, it was hurting me so terribly, and now I don't feel a single thing. Hooray! I'm happy!  I feel fine again. I'm in top form. So do I. Hurrah! I don't think we need your physical exercises anymore, Doctor. I think the fire proved to us we're in good condition and still feeling young. That's how I feel. Yes, I don't think we have any need of those exercises. Yes, we don't have to hop around like rabbits. There you have it, Doctor Snail. Everyone's feeling well and in top condition. That's where you're wrong. We find this special strength only in emergencies. No, you must train. Now, what?  We're all going to run over to that corner there and back. So please, everyone, take your places. We'll start at once. But first, a small and tasty token of my appreciation. No thanks, all the same. Goodbye. Since you're running, run as far as the big holly tree. Then at least it'll do you good. I'm sure you'll agree, Doctor, there's nothing better than...  to keep the body healthy. Have a slice, dear friends. This is one of the most delicious varieties. Goodbye to you. Do you understand why nobody likes my cheese, Dr. Snail? Doctor, my hip! Oh, I never thought cheese would make me run. That cheese in the middle of the meadow every day we'd see everybody run.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  \u00a9 BF-WATCH TV 2021  \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446.",

Very good, we will check. We'll take it upon ourselves to instruct everybody to come here. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Today's examinations have borne out what I suspected, which is that the physical condition of most of you leaves a lot to be desired. If you don't do something about it, you'll all end up as old crocs. You see, that's where the pain in your shoulder comes from. Could I be old already? It's terrible. Now, everyone listen here. As from today and three times a day, you will all do physical exercises to slow down the process of growing old. As you know, physical exercise is the best way to do that. That's a good idea. I'll begin with some stomach exercises so that I can eat much more pollen. You'll definitely come to a bad end. If you carry on like that, one day you'll fall out of the air because your wings won't be able to support you. I hope that'll make you think, Willie. To tell the truth, it won't. It'll still be... It'll be a long time before I'm too heavy to fly. That's no reason for not doing a bit of training. I won't have to train, will I? Oh, yes, you will. It's never too early to start, my dear Maya. Ah, I think you're right. When I think of what happened, perhaps I've become too fat and slow to get out of the way in time. We'll start right away with the exercises. An easy one to begin with. First we run as fast as we can, and then... Every four or five steps we jump into the air like rabbits. Any questions? That sounds too terrible. Do you think we'll manage? I'll practice in my web. Run and jump, must we? No, Doctor, it's too difficult. No, Doctor, it's too difficult. All right, then. Forget it. And in a few months, you'll all be crippled and lame. Help! Help! A fire! Fire! Somebody's house is on fire! Where's the fire? Where's the fire? Look, you can see the smoke. I'll tell you where the fire is. Alexander, it's your own house that's going up in flames. What? You're saying my house is on fire? My house is on fire? Doctor, we can't do any training today. We must go and put Alexander's fire out. That is good training. I don't know if I... I can't help with my body out of condition like this. Enough of your silly jokes, there's no time for that. Everybody down to the stream and fill buckets. Make a long chain to Alexander's house and toss them along. Help Alexander! It's terrible! Fire out! Fire out! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! In such cases, I'm very useful. My valuable staff! My treasure! This is a good opportunity to give a demonstration of my aerobatic flying. I went not too far into the flames. Don't stop now, everyone. The fire's nearly out. Oh, I'm afraid we've arrived too late. The fire's out. Yes, sir. The fire is out. My friends, how on earth am I going to thank you? You're not going to thank me. Thank you for us if I didn't spread any further. Anyone on his own would have been helpless against that inferno. That's true. It shows we should all stick together. I'm always here, always on duty. Anyone can ask me for help any time. It's such a pity that the heat warped the bow of my violin. Can you stop showing off like that? Ow! And how's your hip doing, if I may ask? Good heavens, it was hurting me so terribly, and now I don't feel a single thing. Hooray! I'm happy! I feel fine again. I'm in top form. So do I. Hurrah! I don't think we need your physical exercises anymore, Doctor. I think the fire proved to us we're in good condition and still feeling young. That's how I feel. Yes, I don't think we have any need of those exercises. Yes, we don't have to hop around like rabbits. There you have it, Doctor Snail. Everyone's feeling well and in top condition. That's where you're wrong. We find this special strength only in emergencies. No, you must train. Now, what? We're all going to run over to that corner there and back. So please, everyone, take your places. We'll start at once. But first, a small and tasty token of my appreciation. No thanks, all the same. Goodbye. Since you're running, run as far as the big holly tree. Then at least it'll do you good. I'm sure you'll agree, Doctor, there's nothing better than... to keep the body healthy. Have a slice, dear friends. This is one of the most delicious varieties. Goodbye to you. Do you understand why nobody likes my cheese, Dr. Snail? Doctor, my hip! Oh, I never thought cheese would make me run. That cheese in the middle of the meadow every day we'd see everybody run. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. \u00a9 BF-WATCH TV 2021 End."

We're creating a draft. When it's too hot, the wax melts and the eggs die. We have to save them. Maia, what are you doing? Don't you know you're not supposed to fly, silly girl? I know, but when I move my wings, I go up. THE CITY IN BRAZIL Damn, they're working again They must be crazy The little hole where I sleep at night never gets too hot They shouldn't have built a beehive with so many rooms They're quiet back there, boys Let me warn you that there are enemies of ours who are always waiting to help us catch in the dark. That's why bees can't leave the hive at night. Don't forget that. What's up, Maia? When can we go outside and fly? You said it would be almost there. That's right.

What a mess My pot doesn't have a lid and all the honey got inside Very good Today you learned how to collect honey You'll have fun Music You didn't eat as much as Maia and that's why your pots are still full You can't learn everything in a day, I'm sure Professor Cassandra must have known that by now Rome and Pavia weren't built in a single day, because people have to rest Listen carefully, when you fly be very careful with spiders and their webs They're our worst enemy Oh no! Where's Maia? She's over there, Professor Cassandra Isn't she? Without any sense See how nice the flowers are? Maya, Maya, come here! I'm here, teacher Cassandra Be careful! Maya! Oh!

That's crazy, Maya! It's you, Philip! Did you realize the danger you were in? What do you mean? Didn't you see the spider web? Web? Where is it? Ask Cassandra! What a strange grasshopper, what are you talking about? Maia! We're finally home. Come on, don't spill the honey. Yeah. Watch out! Frustrated! I worked so hard and now I have nothing I won't let them laugh at me I'll fill my pot again Ah! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh. Ah! Huh? Uh, ah! Mm! Ah! Ah! Mm! Ah! Ah! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Aaaaah! What happened? I can't move my wings! They're stuck! Professor Cassandra, where are you? I'm in trouble, help me Professor Cassandra, where are you? Come help me, please What am I going to do when it gets dark? I'll be completely healthy I'm alone in the middle of the forest and I can't fly What's wrong? Why are you so sad? Felipe, it's you! Your wings are all wet Just for my back, I'll give you a ride But might I fall? Hold on I'm going to take some really big jumps Ready? One, two, three! Here we go! Hurry up, this is fun It's much better than flying alone Wow! Not so high, Philip! Your wings must be dry by now, Maia. Yes, I think you're right. Professor Cassandra will want to know where you've been, little Maia. What are you going to tell her? Hmm... I'm sorry, but I can't tell you. I can't help it. I have to go. Goodbye, little Maia! Little Maia never gets tired of flying What she likes most is flying close to the blue sky Towards the sun The next episode is going to be very exciting But I'm not going to tell you why I'm just telling you that it's going to be really fun You'll see Well, until next time! \u00a9 BF-WATCH TV 2021"

Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o pode fazer isso aqui. Rio, que tem o dom de dizer o \u00f3bvio. Como se eu n\u00e3o soubesse. Vamos come\u00e7ar. Pode, por favor, me dizer a data e a hora do seu trabalho?  sequestro do \u00f4nibus? Foi em 20 de dezembro, em frente a Azaghal Rio, \u00e0s 11h02 da manh\u00e3, seguindo para Space Land. 20 de dezembro. E eles estavam a caminho do Space Land, n\u00e3o \u00e9? \u00c9. Assim, ningu\u00e9m vai encontrar o corpo. E se encontrarem, v\u00e3o supor que a morte...  A morte do noivo a levou ao suic\u00eddio. Olha a gra\u00e7a, Ryuki. Desculpe interrogar voc\u00eas dessa maneira, mas n\u00e3o tive outra escolha. Eu comprovei que Kira n\u00e3o est\u00e1 entre n\u00f3s. Ryuzaki, como pode ter certeza de que somos inocentes? Bom, para ser sincero, desde o in\u00edcio eu armei v\u00e1rias armadilhas que reviveram.  revelariam se algum de voc\u00eas \u00e9 o Kira. Mas depois de falar com cada um, n\u00e3o senti necessidade. Com licen\u00e7a. Incr\u00edvel. A gente teve que desligar o celular. Entendido. Estou quase terminando aqui mesmo. Voc\u00ea tem a chave, ent\u00e3o entre. O Atari est\u00e1 vindo pra c\u00e1. Aham. Ent\u00e3o \u00e9 isso, n\u00e9? Eu quero contar tudo.  Tudo para o meu pai, se voc\u00ea concordar, \u00e9 claro. Olha, se der no mesmo, eu prefiro contar pessoalmente. Depois de conversar com voc\u00ea, decidi que \u00e9 melhor fazer isso o mais r\u00e1pido poss\u00edvel. \u00c9, faz sentido. S\u00f3 dez segundos at\u00e9 uma e quinze. Tenho que admitir, eu adoraria v\u00ea-la morrer. Mas n\u00e3o posso ser visto seguindo-a. Ah.  Anda. Corra para sua morte. Kira vai ser pego. Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o acha? O que est\u00e1 havendo? J\u00e1 devia ter acontecido.  Isso n\u00e3o faz sentido. N\u00e3o entendo por que ela n\u00e3o sai. N\u00e3o tive dificuldades em fazer as pessoas se matarem. Era s\u00f3 escrever a palavra suic\u00eddio. Os criminosos que testei se mataram do jeito que eu especifiquei. Meus testes indicam que numa situa\u00e7\u00e3o dessas, eu posso controlar os atos das pessoas. Ent\u00e3o, por qu\u00ea? Ryuki.  Ele riu assim quando eu estava escrevendo no Death Note. E n\u00e3o \u00e9 s\u00f3 isso. Eu lembro de achar estranho ele rir quando perguntei o nome dela. Na verdade, ele reagiu do mesmo jeito todas as vezes que eu disse o nome dela. Nome falso! Senhores, \u00e9 uma honra conhec\u00ea-los. \u00c9 esse o Atari?  Pela roupa, n\u00e3o parece. Se eu me vestisse assim, estaria me anunciando como o Atari. Seria o suficiente para expor a mim e Ryuzaki em nosso local de encontro. Ah, entendi. Geralmente, eu n\u00e3o mostraria meu rosto a nenhum de voc\u00eas. O fato de eu estar aqui \u00e9 que ganharam a confian\u00e7a de Ryuzaki. J\u00e1 que falou nisso, eu me sinto honrado. Ellie, eu trouxe o que pediu. Est\u00e1 tudo aqui. Pode pass\u00e1-los a todos, por favor?  Sim. Senhor, e suas novas identidades policiais? Mas, para qu\u00ea? Ela usou o nome falso. S\u00f3 pode ser isso. Riu que sabia. Ele viu o nome verdadeiro dela com seus olhos. Por isso, ele n\u00e3o parava de rir. Eu devia saber. Ela teve cuidado desde o in\u00edcio. Entendi. Faz sentido. Ela acredita que Ray morreu porque mostrou sua identidade ao Kira. Ent\u00e3o, claro que vai.  Vai tomar cuidado para n\u00e3o revelar o pr\u00f3prio nome. Isso n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada bom. Vai ser quase imposs\u00edvel perguntar o nome verdadeiro, sabendo que ela me deu um falso. Se eu for muito insistente, ela vai suspeitar. O que eu estou pensando? Vai parecer suspeito eu saber que ela usou um nome falso. Acho melhor eu voltar agora. Algu\u00e9m da For\u00e7a-Tarefa j\u00e1 pode ter chegado. Ah, \u00e9 mesmo. Pode ser. Vamos cruzar os dedos e esperar que algu\u00e9m esteja l\u00e1.  Erra. Droga, estou ficando sem op\u00e7\u00f5es. Eu tenho que impedir isso antes que seja tarde demais. Ah, n\u00e3o. E se o meu pai ligar agora? Eu j\u00e1 prometi que deixaria ela falar com ele. Se esse telefone tocar, eu estou acabado. O que eu vou fazer? Isso \u00e9 loucura. \u00c9 s\u00f3 desligar o telefone.  Eu vou tirar o celular. Problema resolvido. Agora, calma. Voc\u00ea sabe o que tem que fazer. Descobrir o nome verdadeiro dela. A bolsa, os bolsos... Ela deve ter uma carteira de motorista ou uma identidade em algum lugar. Ela \u00e9 uma mulher. Se fosse preciso, eu poderia usar a for\u00e7a. N\u00e3o. A \u00faltima coisa que eu preciso \u00e9 uma cena em p\u00fablico. Eu tenho que peg\u00e1-la isoladamente. Mas onde? Em que explica\u00e7\u00e3o eu daria? Nunca d\u00e1.  Ela \u00e9 muito cuidadosa. Preciso me aproximar melhor. Eu consigo. Vou convenc\u00ea-la a me dar seu nome verdadeiro. Light, n\u00e3o esque\u00e7a que meu acordo est\u00e1 sempre em aberto. \u00c9 como colocar lentes de contato. S\u00f3 leva uns segundos. Voc\u00ea acha que eu estaria pronto a abrir a m\u00e3o de metade da minha vida s\u00f3 para saber o nome verdadeiro dessa mulher? N\u00e3o. De jeito nenhum. Na verdade, nem vale a pena considerar. Agora, pare de pensar.  me fazer perder tempo. Cala a boca, Shinigami. Desculpa. Oi? Voc\u00ea ainda tem o que fazer l\u00e1 na pol\u00edcia? \u00c9 que eu prefiro entrar sozinha, se n\u00e3o se importar. Eu n\u00e3o me importo. Nossos nomes e patentes s\u00e3o falsos. Por que nos deu identidades falsas? Como sabem, Kira precisa de um nome e um rosto para matar. Vamos enfrent\u00e1-lo tendo isso em mente. E acho que fica \u00f3bvio o porqu\u00ea. Tudo bem, mas acho que a pol\u00edcia n\u00e3o deveria...  deveria usar identidade falsa. Chega! Que escolha n\u00f3s temos com as capacidades de nosso inimigo? Enquanto trabalharmos nesse caso, acho que vamos precisar de toda a prote\u00e7\u00e3o poss\u00edvel. Seria burrice n\u00e3o us\u00e1-la. \u00c9, acho que tem raz\u00e3o. Lembrem, quando estiverem numa situa\u00e7\u00e3o em que tiverem que dar seu nome a um estranho, usem os nomes de suas identidades falsas, entendido? Certo. E cuidado para n\u00e3o mostr\u00e1-las quando estiverem na presen\u00e7a de outros policiais. Sei que n\u00e3o preciso dizer isso, mas isso pode causar problemas para  Entendo. Muito bem. Ent\u00e3o eu quero pedir que todos voc\u00eas usem isso o tempo todo. Ah, cintos? Cada um tem um transmissor escondido na fivela. Isso vai permitir que Ryuzaki monitore seu paradeiro. Quando apertam a fivela duas vezes assim, meu celular toca mostrando seu nome. E eu ligo imediatamente, mas voc\u00eas n\u00e3o ver\u00e3o meu n\u00famero no seu telefone. De manh\u00e3, todos voc\u00eas ir\u00e3o ao trabalho como sempre.  Depois, mais tarde, vamos usar esse m\u00e9todo para confirmar o nome do hotel do Ryuzaki e seu quarto. Por favor, usem isso tamb\u00e9m para emerg\u00eancias. Gente, isso \u00e9 muito maneiro. Eu me sinto um super agente secreto atr\u00e1s do Kira. Cala essa boca. Isso n\u00e3o \u00e9 hora de bobagem, Matsuda. Para com isso. Sim, senhor. Muito obrigada por tudo que fez, Light. Depois de falar com voc\u00ea, me sinto bem mais confiante sobre a minha teoria. Que bom.  Considerando que Ryuki mencionou de novo a hist\u00f3ria dos olhos, n\u00e3o tenho d\u00favidas de que ela usou o nome falso. Assim, quando ela for \u00e0 pol\u00edcia com sua teoria sobre o Kira no \u00f4nibus e eles olharem todas as pessoas que Ray Pember investigou, n\u00e3o vai demorar para que cheguem a mim. A\u00ed, l\u00e1 vai ela. O que voc\u00ea vai fazer? Tem uns cinco minutos at\u00e9 que essa mulher chegue ao pr\u00e9dio da pol\u00edcia.  Pensa, preciso do nome dela e n\u00e3o tenho tempo a perder. Se essa mulher chegar \u00e0 pol\u00edcia e algu\u00e9m da for\u00e7a-tarefa tiver voltado, estou acabado. Tenho que descobrir o nome dela e mat\u00e1-la r\u00e1pido. S\u00f3 mais tr\u00eas minutos.  minutos at\u00e9 ela chegar ent\u00e3o t\u00e1 l\u00e1 vai e a\u00ed vai fazer o que oi d\u00e1 licen\u00e7a fala tem uma coisa que eu devia te contar t\u00e1 bom \u00e9 que vai ser imposs\u00edvel voc\u00ea entrar em contato com algu\u00e9m da for\u00e7a tarefa diretamente isso mesmo continua conversa s\u00f3 preciso achar alguma coisa que ela possa se agarrar e eu pego quando ela estiver mais \u00e0 vontade eu descubro o nome verdadeiro  Eu consigo. Ainda n\u00e3o entendi. Como assim? N\u00e3o achou estranho n\u00e3o ter ningu\u00e9m no quartel-general da For\u00e7a-Tarefa? \u00c9, eu achei um pouco estranho, sim. Eu vou explicar. A For\u00e7a-Tarefa foi organizada para que seus agentes n\u00e3o fossem identificados e ningu\u00e9m de fora soubesse quem est\u00e1 encarregado. Se os nomes dos agentes se tornarem p\u00fablicos ou a estrutura da For\u00e7a-Tarefa for revelada, podemos ver mais uma trag\u00e9dia como aquela que tirou a vida do seu noivo no metr\u00f4.  \u00c9 verdade. Por isso disseram a voc\u00ea que ningu\u00e9m estava no quartel-general da For\u00e7a-Tarefa. O que eu estou querendo dizer \u00e9 que voc\u00ea nunca vai poder falar diretamente com algu\u00e9m da For\u00e7a-Tarefa porque a pol\u00edcia n\u00e3o vai permitir. Muito esperto. Impressionante. Se deveria ser segredo, como voc\u00ea sabe tanto? Acho que falecido de paz. Ela \u00e9 muito esperta. Claro.  T\u00e1 legal. Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o me deixa escolha. \u00c9 porque eu sou um membro da For\u00e7a-Tarefa tamb\u00e9m. Pera\u00ed, voc\u00ea t\u00e1 dizendo que \u00e9 um agente? Isso mesmo. Ele atualmente comanda a For\u00e7a-Tarefa e lidera a nossa investiga\u00e7\u00e3o. Eu sei. Pra ser sincera, eu j\u00e1 tinha suspeitado. Ele se preocupou que a For\u00e7a-Tarefa diminu\u00edsse muito. V\u00e1rios detetives se demitiram da For\u00e7a-Tarefa com medo de morrer. Ent\u00e3o, apesar do fato de eu ser um estudante, ele decidiu me incluir pra ajudar na investiga\u00e7\u00e3o.  Afinal, eu j\u00e1 ajudei eles a resolver outros casos. Quer dizer que Ellie confia em voc\u00ea? Eu posso ir ao quartel-general da For\u00e7a-Tarefa quando quiser. E posso investigar livremente o que eu quiser. Sabe de uma coisa? Hoje a For\u00e7a-Tarefa \u00e9 formada por poucos escolhidos. Um grupo de elite de gente escolhida a dedo pelo Ellie. Todos altamente habilitados, respeitados e, acima de tudo, confi\u00e1veis.  Obrigada pela explica\u00e7\u00e3o. Mas pra ter certeza, eu quero tentar de novo ir ao quartel-general da For\u00e7a-Tarefa. Tchau. Por favor, espera um pouco. Foi o que eu disse. N\u00e3o v\u00e3o deixar voc\u00ea falar com ningu\u00e9m no quartel. Eu sei, mas esperava falar diretamente com o L. O que \u00e9 isso?  Est\u00e1 na pol\u00edcia agora. Na verdade, n\u00e3o tem ningu\u00e9m l\u00e1 agora. Isso n\u00e3o \u00e9 bom. Precisamos de algu\u00e9m l\u00e1 o tempo todo, trabalhando em turno se for preciso. Positivo. Aizawa, voc\u00ea ser\u00e1 o respons\u00e1vel por isso hoje. Sim, senhor. Eu estou indo e n\u00e3o vou demorar. Senhorita Maki, por favor, um segundo. \u00c9 literalmente imposs\u00edvel encontrar Ellie. N\u00e3o vai adiantar. Voc\u00ea deve ter raz\u00e3o. Mas eu acho que tenho uma chance dele me encontrar.  Eu s\u00f3 tive contato com ele seguindo ordens por computador, mas ele deve lembrar quem eu sou. Eu trabalhei pra ele num caso nos Estados Unidos h\u00e1 uns dois anos. \u00c9 s\u00e9rio? Voc\u00ea j\u00e1 trabalhou pro L? \u00c9, eu nunca conto isso, mas at\u00e9 tr\u00eas meses eu era agente do FBI. Finalmente, \u00e9 isso. Alguma coisa que eu possa usar. Eu n\u00e3o devia me surpreender. Na verdade, percebi que sua habilidade investigativa era boa demais pra um amador.  Voc\u00ea tem bastante cuidado e parece ter o dom de ir ao fundo da quest\u00e3o. Se eu pudesse, gostaria de aprender com voc\u00ea. Uma mentira depois da outra. Como isso \u00e9 f\u00e1cil para voc\u00ea? Eu sempre soube que tinha que fazer as coisas por fora dos canais regulares, porque do meu ponto de vista, tanto a pol\u00edcia quanto os membros da For\u00e7a Tarefa eram suspeitos. Mas eu sei que posso confiar no L. Talvez seja irreal, mas eu achei que se eu viesse pessoalmente e desse o meu nome, tinha chance de me deixarem falar comigo.  Eu falei com ele diretamente. Entendi. Mas se a \u00fanica pessoa que voc\u00ea pode confiar \u00e9 o Ellie, por que falou comigo? Acho que eu estava chateada por n\u00e3o me deixarem ver ningu\u00e9m da For\u00e7a-Tarefa. E a\u00ed voc\u00ea apareceu dizendo ser filho do detetive-chefe. Ent\u00e3o, n\u00e3o. N\u00e3o foi nada disso. Vou ser sincera. \u00c9 porque voc\u00ea me lembrou o Ellie. Voc\u00ea tem alguma coisa que \u00e9 igual a ele.  Quero investigar o caso comigo. H\u00e3? Quero que venha trabalhar conosco como parte da For\u00e7a-Tarefa. Precisamos de sua ajuda. Como deve saber, n\u00e3o \u00e9 qualquer um que pode fazer isso. Por favor, eu sei que \u00e9 repentino, mas a equipe precisa de gente como voc\u00ea. \u00c9 s\u00e9rio, voc\u00ea pode fazer bem mais que unir informa\u00e7\u00f5es sozinha. Voc\u00ea tem toda a experi\u00eancia como agente do FBI e \u00e9 mais talentosa que a maioria dos agentes atuantes.  atualmente na For\u00e7a-Tarefa e o Ellie obviamente confiou em voc\u00ea no passado. N\u00e3o vai ser t\u00e3o dif\u00edcil voc\u00ea se juntar. S\u00f3 preciso de uma identifica\u00e7\u00e3o v\u00e1lida, uma recomenda\u00e7\u00e3o de um membro atual da For\u00e7a-Tarefa e precisa ter a permiss\u00e3o do Ellie. Quer que eu entre na For\u00e7a-Tarefa? S\u00f3 consigo pensar que deve ter sido o destino que me trouxe voc\u00ea hoje. Eu quero recomendar voc\u00ea ao Ellie. Ai, t\u00e1. Me desculpa. Eu acho que eu me empolguei demais, n\u00e3o foi? N\u00e3o.  Tudo bem. Mesmo se agisse como consultora nessa investiga\u00e7\u00e3o, seria de grande ajuda. Eu tenho certeza de que voc\u00ea tem obriga\u00e7\u00f5es pessoais. Al\u00e9m do fato de voc\u00ea viver nos Estados Unidos. \u00c9 verdade. Antes disso tudo acontecer, eu planejava continuar l\u00e1 com o meu noivo. N\u00f3s \u00edamos casar na primavera. Mas agora que ele morreu, eu n\u00e3o sei mais o que fazer. Est\u00e1 \u00f3timo. Cheguei at\u00e9 aqui. Ela s\u00f3 precisa de um empurr\u00e3ozinho. Mas voc\u00ea \u00e9 jovem, bonita, tem uma vida inteira pela frente. Por que colocar a sua vida em perigo?  N\u00e3o! Agora que o Ray morreu, eu n\u00e3o tenho mais nada a perder. Eu quero pegar o Kira. Nada mais me importa. \u00c9 tudo o que eu quero fazer. Por favor, deixe-me investigar esse caso com voc\u00ea. Claro, com certeza. Eu s\u00f3 preciso de uma identifica\u00e7\u00e3o pessoal antes de continuarmos. Ah, t\u00e1... O que foi? Sabe o nome que eu te dei hoje?  N\u00e3o \u00e9 meu nome de verdade. Me desculpe. N\u00e3o se preocupe, tudo bem. Pra ser sincero, estou impressionado de como voc\u00ea foi cuidadosa. Na realidade, voc\u00ea ficou um passo na minha frente. Eu acho que isso s\u00f3 prova as suas capacidades. Ent\u00e3o, uma carteira de motorista japonesa serve? Serve.  Bem na hora. N\u00e3o.  Por que voc\u00ea olha tanto o rel\u00f3gio? Ah, sim. Eu acho que \u00e9 porque... Porque eu sou o Kira.  O que \u00e9 o problema? Eu preciso fazer uma coisa. O celular do meu pai j\u00e1 est\u00e1 dispon\u00edvel agora. Quer ver se consegue falar com ele? N\u00e3o, obrigada. N\u00e3o tenho nada a dizer para ele.  Ent\u00e3o adeus, Naomi Misora. mememememememememememememememe \u3054\u8996\u8074\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f  Formacy",
        "translated": "In the spreading darkness, we exchanged words of wisdom. We can't let anyone fool us, so the quest tells us  Next Episode What are you doing? But your theory makes sense to me. We can't waste any time. We have to start investigating this now. What? Are you serious now? Of course. Have you told anyone else about this? No. You're the first person I've told. You're very lucky, but how are you going to get rid of it? You can't do that here. Rio, who has a gift for stating the obvious. As if I didn't know. Let's get started. Can you please tell me the date and time of your work? bus hijacking? It was on December 20th, in front of Azaghal Rio, at 11:02 in the morning, heading to Space Land. December 20th. And they were on their way to Space Land, right? Yeah. So no one will find the body. And if they do, they'll assume that the death... Her fianc\u00e9's death led her to commit suicide. How funny is that, Ryuki. I'm sorry to interrogate you like this, but I had no other choice. I've proven that Kira is not among us. Ryuzaki, how can you be sure that we are innocent? Well, to be honest, from the beginning I set several traps that revived. would reveal if any of you are Kira. But after talking to each one of you, I didn't feel the need. Excuse me. Awesome. We had to turn off our phones. Understood. I'm almost done here. You have the key, so come on in. Atari is on his way here. Yeah. So that's it, huh? I want to tell you everything. All for my father, if you agree, of course. Look, if it comes to the same thing, I'd rather tell you in person. After talking to you, I've decided it's best to do this as quickly as possible. Yeah, that makes sense. Just ten seconds until a quarter past one. I have to admit, I'd love to see her die. But I can't be seen following her. Oh. Come on. Run to your death. Kira will be caught. Don't you think so? What's going on? It should have happened already. That doesn't make sense. I don't understand why she won't leave. I had no trouble making people kill themselves. I just had to write the word suicide. The criminals I tested killed themselves the way I specified. My tests indicate that in a situation like that, I can control people's actions. So why? Ryuki. He laughed like that when I was writing in the Death Note. And that's not all. I remember thinking it was weird that he laughed when I asked her name. In fact, he reacted the same way every time I said her name. Fake name! Gentlemen, it's an honor to meet you. Is this Atari? From what you're wearing, it doesn't look like it. If I dressed like that, I'd be announcing myself as Atari. It would be enough to expose me and Ryuzaki at our meeting place. Ah, I see. Normally, I wouldn't show my face to any of you. The fact that I'm here is how you've earned Ryuzaki's trust. Since you mentioned it, I feel honored. Ellie, I brought what you asked for. It's all here. Could you pass it out to everyone, please? Yes. Sir, what about your new police IDs? But what for? She used the fake name. That's the only thing she could do. She laughed because she knew. He saw her real name with his eyes. That's why he couldn't stop laughing. I should have known. She was careful from the start. I get it. It makes sense. She believes Ray died because she showed Kira her ID. So, of course she will. You'll be careful not to reveal your own name. That's not good. It'll be almost impossible to ask her real name, knowing that she gave me a fake one. If I'm too persistent, she'll get suspicious. What am I thinking? It'll look suspicious if I know she used a fake name. I think I'd better go back now. Someone from the Task Force might have arrived already. Oh, right. Maybe. Let's cross our fingers and hope someone is there. Wrong. Damn, I'm running out of options. I have to stop this before it's too late. Oh no. What if my dad calls now? I already promised I'd let her talk to him. If this phone rings, I'm done. What am I going to do? This is crazy. Just hang up the phone. I'll take the cell phone. Problem solved. Now, calm down. You know what you have to do. Find out her real name. Her purse, her pockets... She must have a driver's license or an ID somewhere. She's a woman. If necessary, I could use force. No. The last thing I need is a public scene. I have to catch her alone. But where? What explanation would I give? It never works. She's very careful. I need to get closer. I can do it. I'll convince her to give me her real name. Light, remember that my deal is always open. It's like putting on contact lenses. It only takes a few seconds. Do you think I'd be willing to give up half my life just to know this woman's real name? No. No way. In fact, it's not even worth considering. Now, stop thinking. wasting my time. Shut up, Shinigami. Sorry. Hey? Do you still have business at the police station? I'd rather go in alone, if you don't mind. I don't mind. Our names and ranks are fake. Why did you give us fake identities? As you know, Kira needs a name and a face to kill. Let's face it with that in mind. And I think it's obvious why. Okay, but I don't think the police should... should use a fake ID. Enough! What choice do we have with the capabilities of our enemy? As long as we work this case, I think we're going to need all the protection we can get. It would be foolish not to use it. Yeah, I think you're right. Remember, when you're in a situation where you have to give your name to a stranger, use the names on your fake IDs, okay? Okay. And be careful not to show them around other officers. I know I don't have to say this, but it could get you in trouble. I see. Very well. Then I would like to ask that all of you wear these at all times. Oh, belts? Each one has a transmitter hidden in the buckle. This will allow Ryuzaki to monitor your whereabouts. When you fasten the buckle twice like this, my cell phone will ring showing your name. And I will call you immediately, but you will not see my number on your phone. In the morning, all of you will go to work as usual. Later on, we'll use this method to confirm the name of Ryuzaki's hotel and his room. Please use this for emergencies as well. Guys, this is really cool. I feel like a super secret agent after Kira. Shut up. This is no time for nonsense, Matsuda. Stop it. Yes, sir. Thank you very much for everything you did, Light. After talking to you, I feel much more confident about my theory. That's great. Considering Ryuki brought up the eye thing again, I have no doubt she used the fake name. So when she goes to the police with her theory about Kira on the bus and they look at all the people Ray Pember investigated, it won't be long before they get to me. Then there she goes. What are you going to do? You have about five minutes until this woman gets to the police building. Think about it, I need her name and I don't have time to waste. If this woman gets to the police and someone from the task force is back, I'm done. I have to find out her name and kill her fast. Just three more minutes. minutes until she arrives, so there you go, and then you're going to do what you want. Hi, excuse me, there's something I should tell you, okay? It's that it's going to be impossible for you to contact anyone from the task force directly. That's right, keep talking. I just need to find something she can hold on to and I'll get it when she's more comfortable. I'll find out her real name. I can. I still don't get it. What do you mean? Didn't you find it strange that there was no one at the Task Force headquarters? Yeah, I did find it a little strange. Let me explain. The Task Force was organized so that its agents could not be identified and no one on the outside would know who was in charge. If the names of the agents were made public or the structure of the Task Force was revealed, we could see another tragedy like the one that took the life of your fianc\u00e9 on the subway. That's right. That's why they told you that no one was at the Task Force headquarters. What I'm trying to say is that you'll never be able to talk directly to anyone from the Task Force because the police won't allow it. Very clever. Impressive. If it's supposed to be a secret, how do you know so much? I think she's dead. She's very clever. Of course. Okay. You don't give me a choice. It's because I'm a member of the Task Force too. Wait, are you saying you're an agent? That's right. He's currently in charge of the Task Force and leading our investigation. I know. To be honest, I had my suspicions. He was worried that the Task Force would shrink too much. Several detectives had resigned from the Task Force out of fear of their lives. So, despite the fact that I was a student, he decided to include me to help with the investigation. After all, I've helped them solve other cases. Does that mean Ellie trusts you? I can come to the Task Force headquarters whenever I want. And I can investigate whatever I want freely. You know what? Today, the Task Force is made up of a select few. An elite group of people handpicked by Ellie. All highly skilled, respected, and, above all, trustworthy. Thank you for the explanation. But to be sure, I want to try again to go to the Task Force headquarters. Bye. Please wait a bit. That's what I said. They won't let you talk to anyone at the headquarters. I know, but I was hoping to talk to L. directly. What's this? He's at the police station now. In fact, there's no one there right now. That's not good. We need someone there at all times, working shifts if necessary. Positive. Aizawa, you'll be in charge of that today. Yes, sir. I'm coming and I won't be long. Miss Maki, please just a second. It's literally impossible to find Ellie. It's no use. You're probably right. But I think I have a chance of him finding me. I've only had contact with him through computer commands, but he must remember who I am. I worked for him on a case in the States about two years ago. Seriously? Did you ever work for L? Yeah, I never tell people this, but up until three months ago I was an FBI agent. Finally, this is it. Something I can use. I shouldn't be surprised. In fact, I realized his investigative skills were too good for an amateur. You're very careful and seem to have a knack for getting to the bottom of things. If I could, I'd like to learn from you. One lie after another. How is this easy for you? I always knew I had to do things outside of regular channels, because from my perspective, both the police and the Task Force members were suspects. But I know I can trust L. Maybe it's unrealistic, but I figured if I came forward in person and gave my name, I had a chance they'd let me talk to them. I spoke to him directly. I get it. But if the only person you can trust is Ellie, why did you speak to me? I guess I was just upset that they wouldn't let me see anyone on the Task Force. And then you showed up claiming to be the son of the lead detective. So, no. It wasn't like that at all. I'll be honest. It's because you reminded me of Ellie. There's something about you that's just like him. I want to investigate the case with me. Huh? I want you to come work with us as part of the Task Force. We need your help. As you know, not just anyone can do this. Please, I know it's sudden, but the team needs people like you. Seriously, you can do a lot more than just gather information on your own. You have all the experience as an FBI agent and you're more talented than most of the agents out there. You're currently on the Task Force, and Ellie has obviously trusted you in the past. It shouldn't be that hard for you to join. All I need is a valid ID, a recommendation from a current Task Force member, and you need to have Ellie's permission. Do you want me to join the Task Force? All I can think of is that it must have been fate that brought you to me today. I want to recommend you to Ellie. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I guess I got a little carried away, didn't I? No. Okay. Even if you were to act as a consultant in this investigation, it would be a great help. I'm sure you have personal obligations. Besides the fact that you live in the United States. It's true. Before all this happened, I was planning to stay there with my fianc\u00e9. We were going to get married in the spring. But now that he's dead, I don't know what to do anymore. It's great. I've come this far. She just needs a little push. But you're young, beautiful, and have your whole life ahead of you. Why put your life in danger? No! Now that Ray is dead, I have nothing left to lose. I want to catch Kira. Nothing else matters to me. That's all I want to do. Please let me investigate this case with you. Sure, of course. I just need some personal identification before we continue. Oh, okay... What's up? Do you know the name I gave you today? It's not my real name. I'm sorry. Don't worry, it's fine. To be honest, I'm impressed by how careful you were. In fact, you were one step ahead of me. I guess that just proves your capabilities. So, will a Japanese driver's license do? It will. Right on time. No. Why do you look at your watch so much? Oh, yeah. I think it's because... Because I'm Kira. What's the problem? I need to do something. My dad's cell phone is available now. Do you want to see if you can reach him? No, thanks. I have nothing to say to him. So goodbye, Naomi Misora. sameme ... Thank you for watching Formacy"

Primeiro vou ensinar-te coisas mais f\u00e1ceis. Porqu\u00ea que elas fazem isso? N\u00f3s, as abelhas, fazemos isto desde que existimos. E porqu\u00ea que as abelhas fazem isso? Por que?  Porqu\u00ea que n\u00e3o me diz, professora Cassandra? Quero saber porqu\u00ea Como \u00e9 que vou aprender alguma coisa sobre a vida se a senhora n\u00e3o me explica?

Os ovos ficam dentro de favos E passadas algumas semanas necessitam  Nasce uma abelhinha, como aconteceu contigo. Estive num ovo igual \u00e0quelas? Estiveste. V\u00ea como elas colocam um ovo em cada buraquinho. Depois vem outra abelha que fecha o orif\u00edcio com cera. S\u00e3o as obreiras que s\u00f3 trabalham dentro da colmeia. S\u00e3o elas que constroem a colmeia e tomam conta dos ovos. Tenham sempre muito o que fazer, pois todos os dias a abelha-mestra p\u00f5e um grande n\u00famero de ovos. N\u00e3o me parece que te lembra?  Lembres-te como era quando estavas dentro do ovo, pois n\u00e3o? Onde \u00e9 que estar\u00e1 aquela mi\u00fada? \u00c9 pesado. Consegui! Ah, est\u00e1s a\u00ed!

Gostava de saber. Espera at\u00e9 l\u00e1 chegarmos. Depois explico-te tudo. Mas n\u00e3o penses que o mundo l\u00e1 fora \u00e9 s\u00f3 divers\u00e3o? As abelhas pequeninas n\u00e3o podem andar l\u00e1 fora sozinha, percebeste? O mundo l\u00e1 fora \u00e9 perigoso. T\u00eam de perceber como \u00e9 cruel e ter muito cuidado. Sim, eu sei, professora Cassandra. Eu j\u00e1 ando nesta aula h\u00e1 dois anos. Ent\u00e3o deves saber que isto \u00e9 uma vespa e que h\u00e1 inimigos ainda piores. Dez vezes maiores do que n\u00f3s.  Tenham muito cuidado com eles N\u00e3o tenham medo, voltem para os vossos lugares N\u00e3o h\u00e1 vespas dentro da colmeia Elas n\u00e3o podem entrar, por isso n\u00e3o precisam de ter medo nenhum, minhas pequeninas Isto \u00e9 uma r\u00e3 Nunca voem muito baixo sobre a \u00e1gua Sen\u00e3o isto \u00e9 o que pode acontecer Elas t\u00eam uma l\u00edngua muito comprida N\u00e3o se preocupem, as r\u00e3s nunca poder\u00e3o entrar aqui Ah, professora Cassandra \u00c9?  Isso quer dizer que nunca nos devemos aproximar das r\u00e3s. Isso mesmo, Willy. N\u00e3o se esque\u00e7am. Tu \u00e9s o Willy? Sim, sou o Willy. Pareces ser muito esperto. N\u00e3o, eu j\u00e1 ando nesta aula h\u00e1 dois anos. Bem, eu sou a Maya. J\u00e1 ouviste falar de mim? Sim, mas s\u00f3 coisas terr\u00edveis. Fa\u00e7o tantas perguntas \u00e0s pessoas que lhes d\u00e1 vontade de gritar. O mundo pode ser muito cruel. Por exemplo, quando chove n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada agrad\u00e1vel. Quando isso acontecer, voltem para casa ou escondam-se debaixo de uma folha.  Se estiver a chover l\u00e1 fora, qual \u00e9 a melhor coisa que uma abelha pode fazer? Queres ser tu a responder, Willy? Bem, devemos ficar em casa O que \u00e9 que aconteceria se n\u00e3o fic\u00e1ssemos em casa, professora? Eu acabei de vos dizer, querida Que barulho \u00e9 este? Por favor, n\u00e3o saiam dos vossos lugares, eu volto j\u00e1 O que \u00e9 que estar\u00e1 a acontecer? Deve haver algum problema Maia, Maia  Maia, onde \u00e9 que vais? Volta! Volta aqui! Vou l\u00e1 fora! N\u00e3o, Maia! Maia, volta! N\u00e3o \u00e9 seguro ir l\u00e1 para fora! O que \u00e9 que est\u00e3o a fazer? Toma! Toma! Toma!  \u00c9 meu! N\u00e3o, n\u00e3o \u00e9s, n\u00e3o \u00e9s! \u00c9 meu! Parem de lutar, isso \u00e9 da professora Cassandra \u00c9 meu! Tudo \u00e9 que vejo este pote O que \u00e9 que se passa aqui? Pronto, n\u00e3o chores mais, minha pequenina Willy, tu \u00e9s o mais velho V\u00ea l\u00e1 se imp\u00f5es alguma obra  A ordem. Voc\u00eas ouviram o que eu disse? Eu sou o respons\u00e1vel. Fa\u00e7am o que eu digo. Olha, \u00e9 uma vespa. N\u00e3o \u00e9 uma vespa a s\u00e9rio. \u00c9 aquela que vimos antes. \u00c9 s\u00f3 uma figura. Mas j\u00e1 que sou o respons\u00e1vel, vou-lhes mostrar outra coisa.  Isto \u00e9 uma aranha Mesmo feia E tamb\u00e9m perigosa Eu j\u00e1 vi uma a s\u00e9rio Chamava-se Marta e era mesmo m\u00e1 Isso \u00e9 mentira N\u00e3o, n\u00e3o \u00e9 Isto \u00e9 um dente de le\u00e3o N\u00e3o \u00e9 nada N\u00e3o precisa de nada Vai-se embora N\u00e3o \u00e9 nada \u3069\u3046\u3057\u3088\u3046  Que vento t\u00e3o forte que sopra l\u00e1 fora N\u00e3o \u00e9 mesmo nada agrad\u00e1vel O c\u00e9u j\u00e1 n\u00e3o \u00e9 azul A professora Cassandra disse que era azul  O que \u00e9 que est\u00e1 a fazer? Voc\u00eas deviam estar sossegadinhos e a estudar Obrigada, Willy, podes voltar para o teu lugar Maya, \u00e9s capaz de me dizer o que \u00e9 isto? O que \u00e9 isto?  Mas onde \u00e9 que ela est\u00e1? Algu\u00e9m me sabe dizer onde \u00e9 que ela est\u00e1? Algu\u00e9m a viu sair?

        "translated": "The story I'm going to tell Is full of magic and color And a bee will talk About nature and its splendor I asked her if her name was Maia In a world without equal fame Mom, the fantasy Maia who lives the longest Hello, friends! As you can see, I'm a grasshopper My name is Philip, I hope you like me I know I'm weird, but you get used to it, I come here often I don't know what story to tell you Nothing interesting has happened to me today It seems to me that the life of a grasshopper can be very boring Spending the day eating grass and hopping from one place to another isn't very exciting Although I like to eat Oh, yes I wish the butterfly were my friend Ana, come to me I call the bees They bring honey They are so hardworking those little ones that I think they even work too much I always call Allah! Did you collect a lot of honey today? Give me a little drop It's really theirs, always busy all day long. They don't even have time to say hello. How unusual. They even drop their hats. Oh! Oh? Ha! Why are they back so early? They usually stay much longer. But why? What could be going on? This hubbub is not at all common. Maybe we'll get lucky and something interesting will happen. Hello, little worm. Are you going for a walk? Can you talk? No, I don't think she can talk. She's still very young. All she can do is open her mouth. She must be hungry. I know! There must be trouble in the hive. It's on the other side of the ruined castle, behind that big pine tree. It's a nice, safe place. What's going on? Why won't you let me in? You don't know who I am If you don't know the password, you can't come in I don't need a password, I'm Cassandra She was your teacher when you were in school Today is the big day of birth If you don't let me in, all the little bees will die Take a good look at people before you say you don't know them We're very sorry, but we have rules to follow There are many people who try to come in to cause trouble And we are the ones responsible They should have enough common sense to change the rules at such an important moment as this You never stop to think, you fool If we had known it was so important And now can I come in? Yes, Casandra. You can fly in. Petro? Finally We've been waiting for a long time They must be almost hatching Here they come, come on! They don't leave here. How do I get out of here? Is there a door here? It's Maia I'll have to break it Hello Is anyone home? Yes, Maia We've been waiting here for you You were the last one born Who is it, Maia? It's me, Maia Why did you call me Maia? Tell me, please Well, there's no special reason really Everyone has a name Do you have a name too? Yes, my name is Cassandra Take care of you until you grow up Come here Let's go I'm glad you invited me, it's hot It's your fault, the others left a long time ago Why did you take so long? I had a beautiful dream A dream? But bees never dream Maybe one day I'll tell you my dream, it was so much fun Well, should I jump or will Mrs. Cassandra come and get me? Wait, I'll go and get you Calm down Go Go Your life is just beginning and there is so much to learn. Oh! What are they doing? They are learning to live in a swarm. A swarm? What is that? Bees always fly in a swarm. Why? It is a little difficult to understand. First I will teach you some easier things. Why do they do that? We bees have been doing this since the beginning of time. And why do bees do that? Why? Why don't you tell me, Professor Cassandra? I want to know why. How am I going to learn anything about life if you don't explain it to me? Be patient, Mom. I can't explain everything to you at once. Come on, let's go see the others. And inside the honeycomb, the eggs are laid. And why do they do that? The eggs are placed inside the honeycomb. And after a few weeks, they need to be laid. A little bee is born, just like you. Have I been in an egg like those? You have. See how they lay an egg in each little hole. Then another bee comes along and seals the hole with wax. They are the workers who only work inside the hive. They are the ones who build the hive and take care of the eggs. They always have a lot to do, because every day the queen bee lays a large number of eggs. Don't you think that reminds you? Remember what it was like when you were inside the egg, don't you? Where is that little girl? It's heavy. I got it! Oh, there you are! You see, Professor Cassandra, I can do it too. Great, but it's only one egg for each little hole. But why? If the eggs were in pairs, they could talk to each other. That way they wouldn't feel so alone. Maia, we bees weren't born to talk, we were born to work. I'm very worried about you. You have some very strange ideas in that little head of yours. I like my idea, two eggs instead of one. My dear Maia, experience proves that one egg is better. Yes. But tell me why it's better We made bigger divisions for more eggs Come on, let's go Ah, how good it smells I'm so hungry And it's really good, the smell you're feeling is honey Why can't I kill this like the others do? Leave it, it's too heavy for you. Is this honey? Yes, this is where we store Maya honey, come back here right now! This is delicious! You're really mischievous You got all dirty, Maia The honey tastes good But it's so sticky that I can't move my wings Now that they're older I'm going to take them on a trip to the outside world to see the sky Ready Professor Cassandra, can you tell me what heaven is? I'd like to know. Wait until we get there. I'll explain everything to you later. But don't you think that the outside world is just fun? Little bees can't go out there alone, do you understand? The outside world is dangerous. They have to understand how cruel it is and be very careful. Yes, I know, Professor Cassandra. I've been in this class for two years. So you must know that this is a wasp and that there are even worse enemies. Ten times bigger than us. Be very careful with them Don't be afraid, go back to your places There are no wasps inside the hive They can't get in, so you don't need to be afraid at all, my little ones This is a frog Never fly too low over the water Otherwise this is what can happen They have a very long tongue Don't worry, frogs will never be able to get in here Oh, Professor Cassandra Is that so? That means we should never go near frogs. That's right, Willy. Don't forget. Are you Willy? Yes, I'm Willy. You seem very smart. No, I've been in this class for two years. Well, I'm Maya. Have you heard of me? Yes, but only terrible things. I ask people so many questions that they want to scream. The world can be very cruel. For example, when it rains, it's not pleasant at all. When that happens, go home or hide under a leaf. If it's raining outside, what's the best thing a bee can do? Do you want to answer that, Willy? Well, we should stay home. What would happen if we didn't stay home, teacher? I just told you, dear. What's that noise? Please stay where you are, I'll be right back. What's going on? There must be something wrong, Maia, Maia. Maia, where are you going? Come back! Come back here! I'm going outside! No, Maia! Maia, come back! It's not safe to go outside! What are you doing? Take it! Take it! Take it! It's mine! No, you're not, you're not! It's mine! Stop fighting, this is teacher Cassandra's It's mine! All I see is this pot What's going on here? There, don't cry anymore, my little Willy, you're the oldest See if you impose some work The order. Did you hear what I said? I'm in charge. Do what I say. Look, it's a wasp. It's not a real wasp. It's the one we saw before. It's just a figure. But since I'm in charge, I'll show you something else. This is a spider Really ugly And also dangerous I've seen a real one Its name was Marta and it was really bad That's a lie No, it's not This is a dandelion It's nothing It doesn't need anything Go away It's nothing What should I do? Such a strong wind is blowing outside It's really not pleasant The sky is no longer blue Teacher Cassandra said it was blue What are you doing? You guys should be quiet and studying. Thank you, Willy, you can go back to your seat. Maya, can you tell me what this is? What is this? But where is she? Can anyone tell me where she is? Did anyone see her leave? Yes, teacher, I saw her leave I know exactly where she went She went to see the storm What a naughty child I have to keep an eye on that girl The world is beautiful again How funny that little green bug How funny that little green bug WE ARE AT HAND Like a car with the sky always turning It is... Spinning, always spinning One and two and three with me is fun Turn around and you'll see You'll understand This is a pleasure When we dance The flowers spin in the wind Give me the papaya and come from there Come dance with me, sing with me, jump with me. Sing, play, it's fun with me. Come dance, jump with me. Come, wake up, come dance and laugh with me One, two, three Like a car in the sky I'm always spinning Always spinning Spinning Come, you'll see it's fun Very good, very good! Maya! Maia, where are you, Maia? Where are you? Answer immediately It's Cassandra, your teacher Maia, where are you? Maia, Maia Now everything is resolved You always get yourself into trouble Have you seen a little bee? If you're looking for that naughty girl, it's over there Let it stay there for a few minutes and see if it learns its lesson Maia It's the teacher Cassandra She should take advantage of the fact that you're in jail to stab you Sting! You were very naughty, Maia I'll have to punish you and send you to bed right now But I didn't do anything wrong, I just wanted to watch the storm It doesn't matter, you caused a lot of trouble I apologize And don't go out to explore the world again Okay, I apologize Go, let me go Stop standing there quietly and get some sleep. Why am I being naughty just for wanting to see the world outside? Next time I'll be smarter and run away when no one's looking. They'll never find me."

Espera, eu vou buscar-te Calma Vai Vai  Tua vida est\u00e1 apenas a come\u00e7ar e h\u00e1 tanta coisa para aprender. Oh! O que \u00e9 que elas est\u00e3o a fazer? Est\u00e3o a aprender a viver em enxame. Enxame? O que \u00e9 isso? As abelhas voam sempre em enxame. Porqu\u00ea? \u00c9 um bocadinho dif\u00edcil de perceber. Primeiro vou ensinar-te coisas mais f\u00e1ceis. Porqu\u00ea que elas fazem isso? N\u00f3s, as abelhas, fazemos isto desde que existimos. E porqu\u00ea que as abelhas fazem isso? Por que?  Porqu\u00ea que n\u00e3o me diz, professora Cassandra? Quero saber porqu\u00ea Como \u00e9 que vou aprender alguma coisa sobre a vida se a senhora n\u00e3o me explica? Seja paciente, m\u00e3e Eu n\u00e3o te posso explicar tudo de uma vez V\u00e1, vamos ter com as outras Ah E dentro dos favos colocam-se os ovos E porqu\u00ea que fazem isso? Os ovos ficam dentro de favos E passadas algumas semanas necessitam  Nasce uma abelhinha, como aconteceu contigo. Estive num ovo igual \u00e0quelas? Estiveste. V\u00ea como elas colocam um ovo em cada buraquinho. Depois vem outra abelha que fecha o orif\u00edcio com cera. S\u00e3o as obreiras que s\u00f3 trabalham dentro da colmeia. S\u00e3o elas que constroem a colmeia e tomam conta dos ovos. Tenham sempre muito o que fazer, pois todos os dias a abelha-mestra p\u00f5e um grande n\u00famero de ovos. N\u00e3o me parece que te lembra?  Lembres-te como era quando estavas dentro do ovo, pois n\u00e3o? Onde \u00e9 que estar\u00e1 aquela mi\u00fada? \u00c9 pesado. Consegui! Ah, est\u00e1s a\u00ed!  Est\u00e1 a ver, professora Cassandra, eu tamb\u00e9m consigo \u00d3timo, mas \u00e9 s\u00f3 um ovo por cada buraquinho Mas porqu\u00ea? Se os ovos ficassem aos pares, podiam falar uns com os outros Assim j\u00e1 n\u00e3o se sentiam t\u00e3o sozinhos Maia, n\u00f3s as abelhas n\u00e3o nascemos para conversar, nascemos para trabalhar Estou muito preocupada contigo, tens umas ideias muito estranhas nessa cabecinha Eu gosto da minha ideia, dois ovos em vez de um Minha querida Maia, a experi\u00eancia prova que \u00e9 melhor um s\u00f3 ovo Sim  Mas diga l\u00e1 porque \u00e9 que \u00e9 melhor Faz\u00edamos divis\u00f5es maiores para mais ovos Anda, vamos l\u00e1 Ah, que bem que cheira Que fome E \u00e9 mesmo bom, o cheiro que est\u00e1s a sentir \u00e9 do mel  Por que n\u00e3o consigo matar isto como fazem as outras?

Gostava de saber. Espera at\u00e9 l\u00e1 chegarmos. Depois explico-te tudo. Mas n\u00e3o penses que o mundo l\u00e1 fora \u00e9 s\u00f3 divers\u00e3o? As abelhas pequeninas n\u00e3o podem andar l\u00e1 fora sozinha, percebeste? O mundo l\u00e1 fora \u00e9 perigoso. T\u00eam de perceber como \u00e9 cruel e ter muito cuidado. Sim, eu sei, professora Cassandra. Eu j\u00e1 ando nesta aula h\u00e1 dois anos. Ent\u00e3o deves saber que isto \u00e9 uma vespa e que h\u00e1 inimigos ainda piores. Dez vezes maiores do que n\u00f3s.  Tenham muito cuidado com eles N\u00e3o tenham medo, voltem para os vossos lugares N\u00e3o h\u00e1 vespas dentro da colmeia Elas n\u00e3o podem entrar, por isso n\u00e3o precisam de ter medo nenhum, minhas pequeninas Isto \u00e9 uma r\u00e3 Nunca voem muito baixo sobre a \u00e1gua Sen\u00e3o isto \u00e9 o que pode acontecer Elas t\u00eam uma l\u00edngua muito comprida N\u00e3o se preocupem, as r\u00e3s nunca poder\u00e3o entrar aqui Ah, professora Cassandra \u00c9?  Isso quer dizer que nunca nos devemos aproximar das r\u00e3s. Isso mesmo, Willy. N\u00e3o se esque\u00e7am. Tu \u00e9s o Willy? Sim, sou o Willy. Pareces ser muito esperto. N\u00e3o, eu j\u00e1 ando nesta aula h\u00e1 dois anos. Bem, eu sou a Maya. J\u00e1 ouviste falar de mim? Sim, mas s\u00f3 coisas terr\u00edveis. Fa\u00e7o tantas perguntas \u00e0s pessoas que lhes d\u00e1 vontade de gritar. O mundo pode ser muito cruel. Por exemplo, quando chove n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada agrad\u00e1vel. Quando isso acontecer, voltem para casa ou escondam-se debaixo de uma folha.  Se estiver a chover l\u00e1 fora, qual \u00e9 a melhor coisa que uma abelha pode fazer? Queres ser tu a responder, Willy? Bem, devemos ficar em casa O que \u00e9 que aconteceria se n\u00e3o fic\u00e1ssemos em casa, professora? Eu acabei de vos dizer, querida Que barulho \u00e9 este? Por favor, n\u00e3o saiam dos vossos lugares, eu volto j\u00e1 O que \u00e9 que estar\u00e1 a acontecer? Deve haver algum problema Maia, Maia  Maia, onde \u00e9 que vais? Volta! Volta aqui! Vou l\u00e1 fora! N\u00e3o, Maia! Maia, volta! N\u00e3o \u00e9 seguro ir l\u00e1 para fora! O que \u00e9 que est\u00e3o a fazer? Toma! Toma! Toma!  \u00c9 meu! N\u00e3o, n\u00e3o \u00e9s, n\u00e3o \u00e9s! \u00c9 meu! Parem de lutar, isso \u00e9 da professora Cassandra \u00c9 meu! Tudo \u00e9 que vejo este pote O que \u00e9 que se passa aqui? Pronto, n\u00e3o chores mais, minha pequenina Willy, tu \u00e9s o mais velho V\u00ea l\u00e1 se imp\u00f5es alguma obra  A ordem. Voc\u00eas ouviram o que eu disse? Eu sou o respons\u00e1vel.

        "translated": "The story I'm going to tell Is full of magic and color And a bee will talk About nature and its splendor I asked her if her name was Maia In a world without equal fame Mom, the fantasy Maia who lives the longest Hello, friends! As you can see, I'm a grasshopper My name is Philip, I hope you like me I know I'm weird, but you get used to it, I come here often I don't know what story to tell you Nothing interesting has happened to me today It seems to me that the life of a grasshopper can be very boring Spending the day eating grass and hopping from one place to another isn't very exciting Although I like to eat Oh, yes I wish the butterfly were my friend Ana, come to me I call the bees They bring honey They are so hardworking those little ones that I think they even work too much I always call Allah! Did you collect a lot of honey today? Give me a little drop It's really theirs, always busy all day long. They don't even have time to say hello. How unusual. They even drop their hats. Oh! Oh? Ha! Why are they back so early? They usually stay much longer. But why? What could be going on? This hubbub is not at all common. Maybe we'll get lucky and something interesting will happen. Hello, little worm. Are you going for a walk? Can you talk? No, I don't think she can talk. She's still very young. All she can do is open her mouth. She must be hungry. I know! There must be trouble in the hive. It's on the other side of the ruined castle, behind that big pine tree. It's a nice, safe place. What's going on? Why won't you let me in? You don't know who I am If you don't know the password, you can't come in I don't need a password, I'm Cassandra She was your teacher when you were in school Oh, oh, oh Today is the big day of birth If you don't let me in, all the little bees will die Take a good look at people before you say you don't know them We're very sorry, but we have rules to follow There are many people who try to come in to cause trouble And we are the ones responsible They should have enough common sense to change the rules at such an important moment like this You never stop to think, you fool If we had known it was so important And now can I come in? Oh, yes, Casandra, you can fly in Petro? Finally We've been waiting for a long time They must be almost hatching Here they come, come on! They don't leave here. How do I get out of here? Is there a door here? It's Maia I'll have to break it Hello Is anyone home? Yes, Maia We've been waiting here for you You were the last one born Who is it, Maia? It's me, Maia Why did you call me Maia? Tell me, please Well, there's no special reason really Everyone has a name Do you have a name too? Yes, my name is Cassandra Take care of you until you grow up Come here Let's go I'm glad you invited me, it's hot It's your fault, the others left a long time ago Why did you take so long? I had a beautiful dream A dream? But bees never dream Maybe one day I'll tell you my dream, it was so much fun Well, should I jump or will Mrs. Cassandra come and get me? Wait, I'll go and get you Calm down Go Go Your life is just beginning and there is so much to learn. Oh! What are they doing? They are learning to live in a swarm. A swarm? What is that? Bees always fly in a swarm. Why? It is a little difficult to understand. First I will teach you some easier things. Why do they do that? We bees have been doing this since the beginning of time. And why do bees do that? Why? Why don't you tell me, Professor Cassandra? I want to know why. How am I going to learn anything about life if you don't explain it to me? Be patient, Mom. I can't explain everything to you at once. Come on, let's go see the others. And inside the honeycomb, the eggs are laid. And why do they do that? The eggs are placed inside the honeycomb. And after a few weeks, they need to be laid. A little bee is born, just like you. Have I been in an egg like those? You have. See how they lay an egg in each little hole. Then another bee comes along and seals the hole with wax. They are the workers who only work inside the hive. They are the ones who build the hive and take care of the eggs. They always have a lot to do, because every day the queen bee lays a large number of eggs. Don't you think that reminds you? Remember what it was like when you were inside the egg, don't you? Where is that little girl? It's heavy. I got it! Oh, there you are! You see, Professor Cassandra, I can do it too. Great, but it's only one egg for each little hole. But why? If the eggs were in pairs, they could talk to each other. That way they wouldn't feel so alone. Maia, we bees weren't born to talk, we were born to work. I'm very worried about you. You have some very strange ideas in that little head of yours. I like my idea, two eggs instead of one. My dear Maia, experience proves that one egg is better. Yes. But tell me why it's better We made bigger divisions for more eggs Come on, let's go Ah, how good it smells I'm so hungry And it's really good, the smell you're feeling is honey Why can't I kill this like the others do? Leave it, it's too heavy for you. Is this honey? Yes, this is where we store Maya honey, come back here right now! This is delicious! You're really mischievous You got all dirty, Maia The honey tastes good But it's so sticky that I can't move my wings Now that they're older I'm going to take them on a trip to the outside world to see the sky Ready Professor Cassandra, can you tell me what heaven is? I'd like to know. Wait until we get there. I'll explain everything to you later. But don't you think that the outside world is just fun? Little bees can't go out there alone, do you understand? The outside world is dangerous. They have to understand how cruel it is and be very careful. Yes, I know, Professor Cassandra. I've been in this class for two years. So you must know that this is a wasp and that there are even worse enemies. Ten times bigger than us. Be very careful with them Don't be afraid, go back to your places There are no wasps inside the hive They can't get in, so you don't need to be afraid at all, my little ones This is a frog Never fly too low over the water Otherwise this is what can happen They have a very long tongue Don't worry, frogs will never be able to get in here Oh, Professor Cassandra Is that so? That means we should never go near frogs. That's right, Willy. Don't forget. Are you Willy? Yes, I'm Willy. You seem very smart. No, I've been in this class for two years. Well, I'm Maya. Have you heard of me? Yes, but only terrible things. I ask people so many questions that they want to scream. The world can be very cruel. For example, when it rains, it's not pleasant at all. When that happens, go home or hide under a leaf. If it's raining outside, what's the best thing a bee can do? Do you want to answer that, Willy? Well, we should stay home. What would happen if we didn't stay home, teacher? I just told you, dear. What's that noise? Please stay where you are, I'll be right back. What's going on? There must be something wrong, Maia, Maia. Maia, where are you going? Come back! Come back here! I'm going outside! No, Maia! Maia, come back! It's not safe to go outside! What are you doing? Take it! Take it! Take it! It's mine! No, you're not, you're not! It's mine! Stop fighting, this is teacher Cassandra's It's mine! All I see is this pot What's going on here? There, don't cry anymore, my little Willy, you're the oldest See if you impose some work The order. Did you hear what I said? I'm in charge. Do what I say. Look, it's a wasp. It's not a real wasp.

This is a spider Really ugly And also dangerous I've seen a real one Its name was Marta and it was really bad That's a lie No, it's not This is a dandelion It's nothing It doesn't need anything Go away It's nothing What should I do? Such a strong wind is blowing outside It's really not pleasant The sky is no longer blue Teacher Cassandra said it was blue What are you doing? You guys should be quiet and studying. Thank you, Willy, you can go back to your seat. Maya, can you tell me what this is? What is this? But where is she? Can anyone tell me where she is? Did anyone see her leave? Yes, teacher, I saw her leave I know exactly where she went She went to see the storm What a naughty child I have to keep an eye on that girl The world is beautiful again How funny that little green bug How funny that little green bug WE ARE AT HAND A\u7136\u5f8c Fitness It's the afterwards It's the post It's the pencil It's the k\u672c It's the ???

Maia, Maia Now everything is resolved You always get yourself into trouble Have you seen a little bee? If you're looking for that naughty girl, it's over there Let it stay there for a few minutes and see if it learns its lesson Maia It's the teacher Cassandra She should take advantage of the fact that you're in jail to stab you Sting! You were very naughty, Maia I'll have to punish you and send you to bed right now But I didn't do anything wrong, I just wanted to watch the storm It doesn't matter, you caused a lot of trouble I apologize And don't go out to explore the world again Okay, I apologize Go, let me go Stop standing there quietly and get some sleep. Why am I being naughty just for wanting to see the world outside? Next time I'll be smarter and run away when no one's looking. They'll never find me."

THE CITY IN BRAZIL Come on, come on, come on. No, no. Help! The honey is coming out, help! Express, express! Help, help! Help me! Come on! What's going on? Hello! Come on, Maia, come with me! What are you doing? I'm doing the same as the others. I'm flapping my wings. Why? Are you silly? No, you're not silly at all. There were too many bees... And the hive is too hot, Maia. We're creating a draft. When it's too hot, the wax melts and the eggs die. We have to save them. Maia, what are you doing? Don't you know you're not supposed to fly, silly girl? I know, but when I move my wings, I go up. THE CITY IN BRAZIL Damn, they're working again They must be crazy The little hole where I sleep at night never gets too hot They shouldn't have built a beehive with so many rooms They're quiet back there, boys Let me warn you that there are enemies of ours who are always waiting to help us catch in the dark. That's why bees can't leave the hive at night. Don't forget that. What's up, Maia? When can we go outside and fly? You said it would be almost there. That's right. You're always promising but you never take us. What a grump. I'll take them when the time is right. And when will that be? Well, tell us when. How about this afternoon? Maia will learn to fly Maia will learn to fly I'll learn to fly I'll learn to fly For who? Me? Aren't you little Willy? Don't you know I'm Maia? Sorry, I thought you were Willy Maia, you have to go over there Do I look like Willy? No, I don't think so Go, go over there Go, go over there Okay, so who did you decide to come with? Why are you late? I'm sorry I had to tell everyone, it's a very special day in my life I even polished my wings, just look how they shine Come on kids, let's get started Cheers, cheers, cheers, cheers The first time is a little difficult Maya, do you want to try? Yes That's what happens when you try to fly too high Isn't Uri here? Isn't he? He's not here Can't miss this? Why is he so late? Is he sick? Oh, Maia, why are you so sad? Aren't you with the others, Maya? I was, but I came back But why? Why did you come back? Hmm, I didn't want to learn to fly That's not true, Maya You were eager to fly, much more than the others I'm sad because I can't fly I'm tired of trying You knew, didn't you? That's why you came back Never mind, it's okay, Willy Do you want me to tell you a nice story? I'm sure you knew I was ashamed of making a fool of myself trying to fly But you're my friend You are so, my dear You're so my friend Well, look, the little bees are learning to fly I don't see little Maya anywhere Did she misbehave and they didn't let her come? I have to ask Professor Cassandra Yes Grasshoppers don't have to learn to fly We are very intelligent Maia must have misbehaved How rude Doing somersaults when talking to a lady The lady doesn't understand I have energy in my blood And I jump because I'm happy What did little Maia do this time? I know she's very restless And she's always getting into trouble But what happened to her? Just a little more soup No, no You have to get strong Enough, I'm going Come on, do yourself a favor, Willy! You have to eat it all! Open your mouth! Maia, I can't What's wrong with you, Willy? What happened? Help me, I think I'm going to burst But what happened to you? Maia said I didn't have the strength and made me eat it all Maia! It smells so good here It's the flowers They're so beautiful Hello, flower Maia, Maia, where are you? I'm here, teacher Cassandra I'm on my way And? Oh, no! Don't overwhelm me, no! Get out! Get out! This must be a button This button is mine! Go away! Ah! Ah! Hit me on the head with a jar of honey It wasn't on purpose I hope it wasn't Hello, good morning, is anyone home? Watch out, I'm going in with my jar Mmm, I'm going to try it Ah, delicious I'll collect a lot to fill the jar Chayra, so good Oh, I'm so heavy I'm sure I've had enough I think I'm going home Oh Nobody told me this was so heavy Oh I'll have to stop often to rest I'm a caterpillar, not a branch It's the first time little Maia has been out of action Why are you laughing at me? Who are you? Here I am, I've wanted to meet you for a long time Don't be afraid of me, I'm Filipe, the grasshopper and I want to be your friend I know a lot about you Oh yeah, really? Up here Where are you? Can't you stay still in the same place? And what do you know about me? That Nis forgets And you were a little bee inside the hive Have you known me since I was born? Yes! It's very annoying to talk to you, you really have to be always hopping Yes, I'm like that, don't forget that I'm a grasshopper! Hahaha! If you don't hop, you won't get tired! Since you're a servant, you wouldn't have anything to do I like to watch you, Maia You make me laugh Oh, yeah? And I want to help you when you're in trouble You're very mischievous and you're always getting into trouble You're so curious Goodbye, Maia Wait! Flip! What a mess My pot doesn't have a lid and all the honey got inside Very good Today you learned how to collect honey You'll have fun Music You didn't eat as much as Maia and that's why your pots are still full You can't learn everything in a day, I'm sure Professor Cassandra must have known that by now Rome and Pavia weren't built in a single day, because people have to rest Listen carefully, when you fly be very careful with spiders and their webs They're our worst enemy Oh no! Where's Maia? She's over there, Professor Cassandra Isn't she? Without any sense See how nice the flowers are? Maya, Maya, come here! I'm here, teacher Cassandra Be careful! Maya! Oh! It's heading for the spider's web! Maya! Maya! Oh! It's heading for the spider's web! Watch out for the cobwebs, but I don't think you heard me Maya! Come and get me! Maya! By whom did Betshe give birth? Where was she? Ask Cassandra. What a strange grasshopper, what are you talking about? Maia! We're finally home. Come on, don't spill the honey. Yeah. Watch out! Frustrated! I worked so hard and now I have nothing I won't let them laugh at me I'll fill my pot again Ah! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh. Ah! Huh? Uh, ah! Mm! Ah! Ah! Mm! Ah! Ah! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! What happened? I can't move my wings, they're stuck Professor Cassandra, where are you? I'm in trouble, help me Professor Cassandra, where are you? Come help me, please What am I going to do when it gets dark? I'll be completely healthy I'm alone in the middle of the forest and I can't fly What's wrong? Why are you so sad? Felipe, it's you! Your wings are all wet Just for my back, I'll give you a ride But might I fall? Hold on I'm going to take some really big jumps Ready? One, two, three! Here we go! Hurry up, this is fun It's much better than flying alone Wow! Not so high, Philip! Your wings must be dry by now, Maia. Yes, I think you're right. Professor Cassandra will want to know where you've been, little Maia. What are you going to tell her? Hmm... I'm sorry, but I can't tell you. I can't help it. I have to go. Goodbye, little Maia! Little Maia never gets tired of flying What she likes most is flying close to the blue sky Towards the sun The next episode is going to be very exciting But I'm not going to tell you why I'm just telling you that it's going to be really fun You'll see Well, until next time! \u00a9 BF-WATCH TV 2021"

Duas caveiras dormindo? Ganhei de novo, sem ressentimentos. Hein, Hugh? Vem jogar um pouquinho com a gente, s\u00f3 pra variar. N\u00e3o. Despe\u00e7o. N\u00e3o.  e saibam que na hora certa encontrar\u00e3o a salva\u00e7\u00e3o. Yagami, est\u00e1 prestando aten\u00e7\u00e3o? Pode, por favor, traduzir a frase seguinte? Sigam os ensinamentos de Deus e recebam as b\u00ean\u00e7\u00e3os. Assim ser\u00e1. E os mares voltar\u00e3o a ser abundantes e as tempestades furiosas se acalmar\u00e3o. Hoje, aproximadamente \u00e0s 11h da manh\u00e3, um homem de 32 anos,  foi encontrado morto apunhalado em seu apartamento na cidade de Yokohama, prov\u00edncia de Kanagawa. A pol\u00edcia de Kanagawa cuida desse homic\u00eddio. Nas not\u00edcias locais de hoje, o suspeito de assassinato, Naoki Kofuji, foi preso no distrito de Shibuya, T\u00f3quio. Ele est\u00e1 sob cust\u00f3dia acusado do brutal homic\u00eddio de sua companheira, que tinha apenas 25 anos quando foi morta. Entra dia, sai dia. As mesmas not\u00edcias se repetem.  Isso tudo \u00e9 t\u00e3o rid\u00edculo. Esse mundo est\u00e1 podre. Outra consequ\u00eancia \u00e9 a extin\u00e7\u00e3o de v\u00e1rias esp\u00e9cies do planeta. N\u00e3o acredito. Voc\u00ea pagou pra ver isso? Hoje em dia, o n\u00famero de esp\u00e9cies em extin\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 o maior j\u00e1 registrado.  I love you.  Death Note. Caderno da Morte. Modo de usar. O humano cujo nome for escrito nesse caderno morrer\u00e1. Isso \u00e9 rid\u00edculo. Sem falar que \u00e9 m\u00f3rbido. N\u00e3o \u00e9 muito diferente daquelas pir\u00e2mides que voc\u00ea recebe por e-mail. O humano cujo nome for escrito nesse caderno morrer\u00e1. N\u00e3o tem como.  Deve ter alguma coisa errada comigo para eu cogitar isso. Este caderno n\u00e3o surtir\u00e1 efeito a menos que se tenha em mente o rosto daquele cujo nome est\u00e1 sendo escrito. Portanto, outra pessoa com o mesmo nome n\u00e3o ser\u00e1 afetada. Se a causa da morte for escrita at\u00e9 40 segundos depois do nome da pessoa, segundo a unidade de tempo,  No tempo dos humanos, assim ser\u00e1 feito. Se a causa da morte n\u00e3o for especificada, a pessoa morrer\u00e1 de uma parada card\u00edaca. Ap\u00f3s a causa, os detalhes da morte devem ser fornecidos nos pr\u00f3ximos 6 minutos e 40 segundos. Ent\u00e3o, dependendo da pessoa que tem em mente, pode mat\u00e1-lo facilmente ou com dor. Isso \u00e9 detalhado demais para ser brincadeira. Ent\u00e3o, escreva o nome da pessoa...  E ela morre. Como se algu\u00e9m acreditasse nisso. Espera a\u00ed. Se algu\u00e9m morrer de verdade, isso me torna um assassino? T\u00e1 legal. Isso \u00e9 totalmente imposs\u00edvel.  O mesmo criminoso que atacou seis pessoas no shopping em Shijuku ontem atacou novamente, fazendo oito pessoas ref\u00e9ns numa creche. Os ref\u00e9ns incluem crian\u00e7as e monitores. A pol\u00edcia identificou o suspeito como sendo Kuro Otoharada, de 42 anos, atualmente desempregado. Esperamos que as negocia\u00e7\u00f5es se iniciem logo. Uma parada card\u00edaca em 40 segundos. Vamos ver. Nesse momento \u00e9 s\u00f3 o que a pol\u00edcia revela.  Estamos todos preocupados com a seguran\u00e7a desses ref\u00e9ns. Voc\u00ea tem raz\u00e3o. Vamos continuar a monitorar a situa\u00e7\u00e3o aqui. Obrigada pelas not\u00edcias. O que acha disso, Sr. Hashimoto? Bom, s\u00f3 podemos esperar uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o r\u00e1pida para essa situa\u00e7\u00e3o. Parece que o caderno n\u00e3o funciona. Bom, eu n\u00e3o esperava que funcionasse. Espera, estamos vendo alguma coisa. Parece que tem movimento na porta da frente. Os ref\u00e9ns est\u00e3o saindo e eles parecem ilesos.  As for\u00e7as especiais est\u00e3o em a\u00e7\u00e3o. Eles v\u00e3o entrar. N\u00e3o sabemos se o suspeito foi preso. Sim. T\u00e1, agora temos confirma\u00e7\u00e3o. O suspeito foi encontrado morto l\u00e1 dentro. Repito, o suspeito est\u00e1 morto. Morto? As for\u00e7as especiais negam as alega\u00e7\u00f5es e atiraram no suspeito. Ent\u00e3o o senhor acha que ele ficou acuado e cometeu o suic\u00eddio? Bom, de acordo com os ref\u00e9ns, o suspeito teve um ataque fulminante. Uma coisa card\u00edaca.  Eu n\u00e3o acredito. \u00c9 coincid\u00eancia. S\u00f3 pode ser coincid\u00eancia. Light! J\u00e1 s\u00e3o seis e meia, sabia? Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o tem curso hoje \u00e0 noite? Tenho. J\u00e1 j\u00e1 eu t\u00f4 pronto. Death Note. \u00c9 improv\u00e1vel, mas se essa coisa for real... Eu tenho que testar mais uma vez. E nesse caso, \u00e9 melhor ser mais um criminoso. Mas se ele for muito conhecido...  Eu vou ter problemas. Se ele morrer, tem uma boa possibilidade da not\u00edcia sobre a morte dele ser acobertada. E eu tenho que ver os resultados logo. Hi-oh! Amigo! O que foi, Sudo? Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o disse que me emprestaria 2 mil ienes? O qu\u00ea? De novo? Eu n\u00e3o posso fazer isso! Sudo, acho que eu devia tentar matar esse cara. N\u00e3o. \u00c9 melhor evitar matar pessoas que eu conhe\u00e7o. U\u00e9, mas ser\u00e1 que isso importa mesmo? Algu\u00e9m se importaria se um cara como voc\u00ea  como ele desaparecesse algum dia? Maneiro! Acho que a gente vai passar no shopping depois da escola. Olha, n\u00f3s vamos ter uma festa de solteiros amanh\u00e3. Voc\u00ea quer vir? \u00c9 claro! Ah, eu n\u00e3o vou perder por nada. Droga, por que minha m\u00e3e \u00e9 t\u00e3o in\u00fatil? Ela nunca vem me buscar na hora. Quando voc\u00ea come\u00e7a a olhar em volta, se pergunta se faria um favor \u00e0 sociedade se livrando de todas essas pessoas. Ah, oi!  Ei, gatinha, onde voc\u00ea vai? Vem se divertir com a gente. Esse Otaku acha uma gostosa a quil\u00f4metros de dist\u00e2ncia. E a\u00ed, gatinha, eu sou Otaku Shibuimaru. O que voc\u00ea acha? Vem ficar com a gente, gatinha. Por favor, eu n\u00e3o quero problema. E ouviu s\u00f3? N\u00e3o quer problema. N\u00e3o \u00e9 bonitinho? Vamos, pessoal. Tirem logo a roupa lenta. \u00c9? Tem certeza? N\u00e3o!  Pare! Ih! Vov\u00f3! Vov\u00f3! Aaaaaah! E agora? O que ser\u00e1 que vai acontecer? Espera! Volta! Corpo n\u00e3o! \u00c9 isso. O Death Note... \u00c9 real. Ah, n\u00e3o!  Taku! Garoto idiota, ele saiu do nada. Sabe, \u00e9 melhor eu ir andando. Faz cinco dias. Ent\u00e3o, \u00e9 melhor eu ir andando.  Vai para algum lugar, Luke? Lamento, mas nosso mundo todo \u00e9 assim. \u00c9 verdade, mas eu perdi o meu Death Note. Fez besteira, n\u00e3o foi? D\u00e1 um tempo. Voc\u00ea j\u00e1 n\u00e3o cantou o velho para ter um segundo livro? N\u00e3o me diz que perdeu os dois. Voc\u00ea deve ter alguma ideia de onde deixou essa coisa. Tenho. No mundo dos humanos. O qu\u00ea?  A CIDADE NO BRASIL Que surpresa boa. N\u00e3o esperava voc\u00ea em casa t\u00e3o cedo. Sim.  Oi, m\u00e3e. \u00c9 porque... Ah, t\u00e1. O resultado das provas, n\u00e9? Estou esperando o dia todo. T\u00e1 aqui. Parab\u00e9ns! O primeiro de novo. \u00c9 a maior pontua\u00e7\u00e3o que j\u00e1 teve. \u00c9, eu acho, n\u00e9? Vou estudar no quarto. N\u00e3o me interrompe, n\u00e3o, t\u00e1? Por favor. Voc\u00ea quem sabe. Ah, Light, voc\u00ea quer alguma coisa, querido? Pode pedir o que quiser. N\u00e3o, t\u00e1 tudo bem, m\u00e3e. Obrigado.  Eu j\u00e1 tenho o que eu quero. Vejo que pegou gosto pela coisa.  Por que ficou t\u00e3o surpreso? Eu sou o Shinigami Ryuki. Esse caderno era meu. A julgar pela sua risada, voc\u00ea j\u00e1 descobriu que o que tem na m\u00e3o n\u00e3o \u00e9 um caderno comum. Shinigami. Um deus da morte. N\u00e3o estou surpreso. Na verdade...  Eu estava te esperando, Ryuki. Ah. Eu j\u00e1 descobri que esse caderno \u00e9 real. E nem demorei muito. E agora que testemunhei a prova do seu poder, eu s\u00f3 me sinto mais confiante no que vou fazer. Que interessante. Eu n\u00e3o estava esperando isso. V\u00e1rios Death Notes chegaram ao mundo humano no passado. Mas voc\u00ea \u00e9 o primeiro a escrever tantos nomes. Olha quantos.  Quantas pessoas voc\u00ea matou em apenas cinco dias? A maioria ficaria relutante em escrever tanto. Eu j\u00e1 me preparei, Ryuki. Usei o caderno mesmo sabendo que ele pertencia a um Shinigami. E agora que esse Shinigami chegou, o que vai acontecer comigo? Vai levar a minha alma? Como assim? Isso \u00e9 alguma fantasia que voc\u00eas humanos inventaram? Eu n\u00e3o vou fazer nada com voc\u00ea. O caderno se torna parte do mundo dos humanos.  no momento em que ele toca a terra. Em outras palavras, o caderno agora \u00e9 seu. Ele \u00e9 meu? Se n\u00e3o quiser, \u00e9 s\u00f3 dar a outra pessoa. Mas se der, eu serei obrigado a apagar suas lembran\u00e7as do caderno. Ent\u00e3o est\u00e1 dizendo que eu posso usar o Death Note o quanto quiser e n\u00e3o vou ser punido? Digamos assim, voc\u00ea vai sentir o medo e a dor que s\u00f3 os humanos que usaram o caderno conhecem. E quando for sua vez de morte...  Ele vir\u00e1 para mim para que eu escreva seu nome no meu Death Note. Saiba que nenhum humano que usou o Death Note... pode ir para o c\u00e9u ou para o inferno pela eternidade. S\u00f3 isso. Agora voc\u00ea tem o que esperar depois da morte. Light? N\u00e3o tem problema. Pode abrir.  O que foi? Achei que gostaria das ma\u00e7\u00e3s que os vizinhos trouxeram. Por que est\u00e1 t\u00e3o escuro no seu quarto? Vai acabar com a sua vista. O que est\u00e1 acontecendo? Minha m\u00e3e n\u00e3o consegue v\u00ea-lo? Aquele caderno que voc\u00ea encontrou pertencia a mim. E j\u00e1 que voc\u00ea est\u00e1 usando ele agora, voc\u00ea \u00e9 o \u00fanico que pode me ver. E claro, minha voz s\u00f3 pode ser ouvida por voc\u00ea. Em outras palavras, o Death Note \u00e9 ligado a voc\u00ea.  entre Light, o humano, e Ryuk, o Shinigami. Delicioso. S\u00f3 tenho mais uma pergunta pra fazer. Por que eu fui escolhido pra isso? Oh, voc\u00ea t\u00e1 me ouvindo? As ma\u00e7\u00e3s no mundo dos humanos valem a viagem. Qual \u00e9 a melhor maneira de descrever isso? Suculenta? Responda a minha pergunta. Eu n\u00e3o escolhi voc\u00ea. Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o veio.  Isso foi um acidente. Voc\u00ea achou mesmo que tinha sido escolhido porque \u00e9 muito inteligente? N\u00e3o seja t\u00e3o vaidoso. Ele caiu aqui por acaso, e por acaso voc\u00ea pegou. \u00c9 s\u00f3 isso. Por isso que escrevi as instru\u00e7\u00f5es em ingl\u00eas, a l\u00edngua mais popular no mundo humano. Ent\u00e3o por que voc\u00ea largou o caderno? Escreveu at\u00e9 as instru\u00e7\u00f5es espec\u00edficas. Ent\u00e3o n\u00e3o venha me dizer que isso foi um acidente. Est\u00e1 me perguntando por qu\u00ea? Fez isso porque estava impediado.  Entendiado. O Shinigami n\u00e3o tem muito o que fazer hoje em dia. A maior parte do tempo, ou cochilamos ou jogamos. Se voc\u00ea aproveita o tempo para escrever nomes em seu Death Note, os outros riem de voc\u00ea por trabalhar muito. Se escrever o nome de outro Shinigami, n\u00e3o adianta porque eles n\u00e3o morrem. E j\u00e1 que vivemos num mundo dos Shinigamis, tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada divertido matar no mundo dos humanos. Ent\u00e3o, achei que seria mais divertido se eu viesse aqui e pensasse...  Pessoalmente. Estou surpreso com tantos nomes que voc\u00ea escreveu. Mas quero saber por que voc\u00ea escreveu a causa da morte s\u00f3 daquele cara que foi atingido pelo caminh\u00e3o. Se n\u00e3o escrever a causa da morte, a v\u00edtima morre de parada card\u00edaca. E essa deve ser a melhor coisa do Death Note, Ryuki. \u00c9? Sabia que eu j\u00e1 pesquisei a lista dos maiores criminosos do mundo? E um dia eu vou me livrar de todos eles. E qual o sentido de fazer isso? \u00c9 quest\u00e3o de tempo at\u00e9 descobrirem que esse...  Estes criminosos est\u00e3o sendo eliminados por algu\u00e9m. Quero que o mundo saiba da minha exist\u00eancia. Que saiba que existe algu\u00e9m por a\u00ed julgando os maldosos. Por que se preocupa? O que quer ganhar julgando todos eles? Por que voc\u00ea se importa? Porque eu tamb\u00e9m estava entediado. Eu n\u00e3o estava pronto para acreditar. Mas agora \u00e9 \u00f3bvio. Tem alguma coisa no Death Note?  que faz os humanos quererem experimentar pelo menos uma vez. Eu matei os dois. Eu matei dois homens. Aquelas eram vidas humanas. Isso n\u00e3o vai ser esquecido. Al\u00e9m do mais, quem sou eu para julgar as pessoas? N\u00e3o. N\u00e3o. Talvez eu esteja errado. Era exatamente nisso que eu estava pensando. Esse mundo est\u00e1 podre. E aqueles que fazem isso...  apodrecer merecem morrer. Algu\u00e9m tem que fazer isso. Ent\u00e3o por que n\u00e3o eu? Mesmo se for preciso sacrificar minha mente e minha alma, vale a pena, porque o mundo n\u00e3o pode continuar assim. O que aconteceria se outra pessoa pegasse esse caderno? Tem mais algu\u00e9m por a\u00ed, al\u00e9m de mim, que queira eliminar os vermes do mundo? Se eu n\u00e3o fizer isso, quem vai fazer? Ent\u00e3o n\u00e3o tem mais ningu\u00e9m. Mas eu posso fazer. Na verdade, eu sou um  \u00fanico que pode eu vou fazer isso usando def note eu vou mudar o mundo  Primeiro escrevi os nomes dos piores criminosos que eu pude lembrar, como se limpasse o mundo um nome de cada vez. Para que um dia ningu\u00e9m fa\u00e7a nada mais de mal. Enquanto os verdadeiramente culpados que merecem ser punidos por seus crimes morrem de parada card\u00edaca, a gente vai ver.  As pessoas menos culpadas, mas que ainda causam problemas, ser\u00e3o gradualmente apagadas por doen\u00e7a ou morte acidental. Ent\u00e3o, e s\u00f3 ent\u00e3o, o mundo vai come\u00e7ar a se mover na dire\u00e7\u00e3o certa. Ser\u00e1 um novo mundo, livre de injusti\u00e7a e populado por pessoas que eu julguei serem honestas, gentis e trabalhadoras. Mas se fizer isso, voc\u00ea vai ser a \u00fanica pessoa m\u00e1 no mundo. H\u00e3? N\u00e3o fa\u00e7o a m\u00ednima ideia do que est\u00e1 falando. Eu sou um grande aluno esfor\u00e7ado, que \u00e9 considerado um dos melhores e mais brilhantes do Jap\u00e3o.  E eu? Eu vou me tornar o deus desse novo mundo. Foi o que imaginei.

Two sleeping skulls? I win again, no hard feelings. Hey, Hugh? Come play with us for a little while, just for a change. No. I'm dismissed. No. and know that at the right time you will find salvation. Yagami, are you paying attention? Can you please translate the following sentence? Follow God's teachings and receive the blessings. So it will be. And the seas will once again be abundant and the raging storms will calm down. Today, at approximately 11:00 a.m., a 32-year-old man, was found stabbed to death in his apartment in Yokohama City, Kanagawa Prefecture. The Kanagawa Police are handling this homicide. In today's local news, murder suspect Naoki Kofuji was arrested in Shibuya Ward, Tokyo. He is in custody accused of the brutal murder of his partner, who was just 25 years old when she was killed. Day in, day out. The same news repeats itself. This is all so ridiculous. This world is rotten. Another consequence is the extinction of several species on the planet. I can't believe it. Did you pay to see this? Today, the number of species facing extinction is the highest ever recorded. I love you. Death Note. How to use it. The human whose name is written in this notebook will die. This is ridiculous. Not to mention morbid. It's not much different from those pyramids you receive in your email. The human whose name is written in this notebook will die. There's no way. There must be something wrong with me for me to think this. This notebook will have no effect unless the face of the person whose name is being written is in mind. Therefore, another person with the same name will not be affected. If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of the person's name, according to the unit of time, In human time, this is how it will be done. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will die of cardiac arrest. After the cause, the details of the death must be given within the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds. Then, depending on the person you have in mind, you can kill them easily or painfully. This is too detailed to be a joke. So, write down the person's name... And she dies. As if anyone would believe that. Wait a minute. If someone actually dies, does that make me a murderer? Okay. That's totally impossible. The same criminal who attacked six people at a shopping mall in Shijuku yesterday has struck again, taking eight people hostage at a daycare center. The hostages include children and caretakers. Police have identified the suspect as Kuro Otoharada, 42, who is currently unemployed. We hope negotiations begin soon. Cardiac arrest in 40 seconds. Let's see. At this point, that's all the police have to say. We are all concerned about the safety of these hostages. You are right. We will continue to monitor the situation here. Thank you for the update. What do you think of this, Mr. Hashimoto? Well, we can only hope for a quick resolution to this situation. It seems that the notebook does not work. Well, I did not expect it to work. Wait, we are seeing something. It seems that there is movement at the front door. The hostages are coming out, and they appear unharmed. The special forces are in action. They're going in. We don't know if the suspect has been arrested. Yes. Okay, now we have confirmation. The suspect was found dead inside. I repeat, the suspect is dead. Dead? The special forces deny the allegations and shot the suspect. So you think he was cornered and committed suicide? Well, according to the hostages, the suspect had a massive attack. A heart problem. I don't believe it. It's a coincidence. It can only be a coincidence. Light! It's already six thirty, you know? Don't you have a class tonight? I do. I'll be ready soon. Death Note. It's unlikely, but if this thing is real... I have to test it one more time. And in that case, it's better to be another criminal. But if he's very well-known... I'm going to be in trouble. If he dies, there's a good chance that the news about his death will be covered up. And I have to see the results soon. Hi-oh! Buddy! What's up, Sudo? Didn't you say you'd lend me 2,000 yen? What? Again? I can't do this! Sudo, I think I should try to kill this guy. No. It's better to avoid killing people I know. Hey, but does it really matter? Would anyone care if a guy like you like he just disappeared one day? Cool! I think we're going to stop by the mall after school. Hey, we're having a bachelor's party tomorrow. Do you want to come? Of course! Oh, I wouldn't miss it for anything. Damn, why is my mom so useless? She never picks me up on time. When you start looking around, you wonder if you'd be doing society a favor by getting rid of all these people. Oh, hi! Hey, kitty, where are you going? Come have some fun with us. This Otaku finds a hottie miles away. Hey, kitty, I'm Otaku Shibuimaru. What do you think? Come hang out with us, kitty. Please, I don't want any trouble. And did you hear that? You don't want any trouble. Isn't that cute? Come on, guys. Take off your clothes, slow. Really? Are you sure? No! Stop! Oh! Grandma! Grandma! Aaaaaah! What now? What do you think will happen? Wait! Come back! Not the body! That's it. The Death Note... It's real. Oh, no! Taku! Stupid boy, he came out of nowhere. You know, I better get going. It's been five days. So, I better get going. Are you going somewhere, Luke? I'm sorry, but our whole world is like that. It's true, but I lost my Death Note. You messed up, didn't you? Give me a break. Didn't you already sing the old man to get a second book? Don't tell me you lost both. You must have some idea where you left that thing. I do. In the human world. What? THE CITY IN BRAZIL What a nice surprise. I didn't expect you home so soon. Yes. Hi, Mom. It's because... Oh, okay. The test results, right? I've been waiting all day. Here they are. Congratulations! First again. That's the highest score you've ever had. Yeah, I think, right? I'm going to study in my room. Don't interrupt me, okay? Please. It's up to you. Oh, Light, do you want anything, dear? You can ask for whatever you want. No, it's okay, Mom. Thank you. I already have what I want. I see you've developed a taste for it. Why are you so surprised? I am the Shinigami Ryuki. This notebook was mine. Judging by your laughter, you've already figured out that what you're holding in your hand is no ordinary notebook. Shinigami. A god of death. I'm not surprised. In fact... I've been waiting for you, Ryuki. Ah. I've already discovered that this notebook is real. And it didn't take me long. And now that I've witnessed proof of your power, I only feel more confident in what I'm going to do. How interesting. I wasn't expecting this. Several Death Notes have reached the human world in the past. But you're the first to write down so many names. Look how many. How many people have you killed in just five days? Most people would be reluctant to write so much. I've already prepared myself, Ryuki. I used the notebook even though I knew it belonged to a Shinigami. And now that this Shinigami has arrived, what will happen to me? Will he take my soul? What do you mean? Is this some fantasy you humans have made up? I won't do anything to you. The notebook becomes part of the human world. the moment it touches the ground. In other words, the notebook is now yours. Is it mine? If you don't want it, just give it to someone else. But if you do, I will be forced to erase your memories from the notebook. So you're saying that I can use the Death Note as much as I want and I won't be punished? Let's put it this way, you will feel the fear and pain that only humans who have used the notebook know. And when it's your turn to die... He will come to me so that I may write his name in my Death Note. Know that no human who has used the Death Note... can go to heaven or hell for eternity. That's all. Now you have what to look forward to after death. Light? No problem. You can open it. What's wrong? I thought you'd like the apples the neighbors brought. Why is it so dark in your room? It's going to ruin your eyesight. What's going on? Can't my mom see you? That notebook you found belonged to me. And since you're using it right now, you're the only one who can see me. And of course, my voice can only be heard by you. In other words, the Death Note is tied to you. between Light, the human, and Ryuk, the Shinigami. Delicious. I just have one more question to ask. Why was I chosen for this? Oh, are you listening to me? The apples in the human world are worth the trip. What's the best way to describe it? Juicy? Answer my question. I didn't choose you. You didn't come. This was an accident. Did you really think you were chosen because you are so smart? Don't be so conceited. It fell here by chance, and you picked it up by chance. That's all. That's why I wrote the instructions in English, the most popular language in the human world. So why did you put the notebook down? You even wrote down the specific instructions. So don't tell me this was an accident. Are you asking me why? You did it because you were prevented. Bored. Shinigami don't have much to do these days. Most of the time, we either nap or play games. If you take the time to write names in your Death Note, the others laugh at you for working too hard. If you write the name of another Shinigami, it's no use because they don't die. And since we live in a Shinigami world, it's no fun to kill in the human world either. So, I thought it would be more fun if I came here and thought... Personally, I'm surprised at how many names you wrote. But I want to know why you wrote the cause of death only for the guy who got hit by the truck. If you don't write the cause of death, the victim dies of cardiac arrest. And that must be the best thing about Death Note, Ryuki. Really? Did you know that I've already researched the list of the world's greatest criminals? And one day I'm going to get rid of them all. And what's the point of doing that? It's only a matter of time before they find out that this... These criminals are being eliminated by someone. I want the world to know I exist. To know that there is someone out there judging the evil ones. Why do you care? What do you want to gain by judging all of them? Why do you care? Because I was bored too. I wasn't ready to believe it. But now it's obvious. Is there something in the Death Note? that makes humans want to try it at least once. I killed them both. I killed two men. Those were human lives. That will not be forgotten. Besides, who am I to judge people? No. No. Maybe I'm wrong. That's exactly what I was thinking. This world is rotten. And those who do this... rot deserve to die. Someone has to do it. So why not me? Even if it means sacrificing my mind and soul, it's worth it, because the world can't go on like this. What would happen if someone else picked up this notebook? Is there anyone else out there besides me who wants to eliminate the vermin from the world? If I don't do it, who will? Well, there's no one else. But I can do it. In fact, I am a only one who can i will do it using def note i will change the world First I wrote down the names of the worst criminals I could think of, as if I were cleaning the world one name at a time. So that one day no one would do anything bad anymore. While the truly guilty who deserve to be punished for their crimes die of cardiac arrest, we'll see. The people who are less guilty but still cause trouble will gradually be eliminated by illness or accidental death. Then, and only then, will the world begin to move in the right direction. It will be a new world, free from injustice and populated by people I have judged to be honest, kind, and hard-working. But if you do that, you will be the only bad person in the world. Huh? I have no idea what you are talking about. I am a great, hard-working student who is considered one of the best and brightest in Japan. And me? I'm going to become the god of this new world. That's what I imagined. Humans are so interesting. Thank you for watching thank you for your hard work I'm gonna show the world what happens when they try to cross me The whole world is watching now L"

        "original": " Once upon a time, you see, In a strange land not far away, I met for chance a little bee, Upon a most unusual day. And when I asked her who she was, she told me, My, ah, no other bee could ever be like you.  Maya, Maya, why you question me? Why is no, no answer for a bee? My, my, she's always in a pretty pickle. Maya, helping someone else's little. Maya, Maya, everyone loves Maya. Maya, Maya, Maya.  Maya, Maya, come tell us what you see.  Oh, hello my friends. As you can see, I'm a grasshopper. My name is Flip. I hope you like me. I know I look funny, but you'll get used to me. I come here often. At the moment, I'm not sure what story to tell you. Nothing interesting has happened to me today at all. I think the life of a grasshopper can be very boring. Eating grass all the time and hopping about isn't very exciting, although I do like eating. I'm bored.  I wish that butterfly there was my friend. There's a swarm of bees coming along. Back from gathering honey. They're such hard-working little fellows. I really think they work too hard. They always fly in a swarm. Hello. Hello, my friends. Hello. Did you collect a lot of honey today? I'd be so happy if you'd give me a drop. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.  Not even time to say hello. How unfriendly they are. They make me drop my hat. Oh. Ah. I wonder why I know it's dead back so early. They usually stay away much longer. Something must be wrong. I wonder what is happening. All this buzzing about, it's most unusual. Perhaps we're in luck and something exciting is going to happen. Hello, little creepy crawly. Are you going for a walk?  a walk? I wonder if he can talk. No, I don't think he can talk. He's still too young. He's just like a baby. All he does is open his mouth. I think he must be hungry. I know. There must be trouble in the beehive. It's on the other side of the ruined castle behind the big pine tree. A fine, safe place. I'll jump down and go and see.  Hmm? What's the matter? Why don't you let me in? Don't know who I am? If you don't know the password, you can't come in. Of course you know me. I'm Cassandra. I was your teacher when you were at school. Oh, so I am?  Cassandra! Today's a great hatching day. If you don't let me in, all the little bees will die. You should have a good look at people before you say you don't know them. We're so sorry, but you know we've got rules to obey. Lots of people try to get in here and make trouble, and we're in charge here. You ought to have enough sense to change the rules at an important time like this. Don't you ever think first, you silly boy? He didn't know it was so important. Can I come in now? Yes, all right, Cassandra. Fly in. Yes, yes.  Here I am at last. We've been waiting a long time. They might hatch out any moment now. They're coming. Let's help them.  Stay where I put you.  How do I get out of here? I wonder if there's a door somewhere. Oh, dear. Hear that? That's Maya. I'll just have to break it open. Hello. Anyone at home?  Yes, Maya. We've been waiting for you. You're the last one to come out. And who is Maya? Am I Maya? Why did you call me Maya? Tell me, please. Well, actually, there's no real reason. Everybody's got to have a name. Oh, have you got a name? Yes, I'm Cassandra. I'll look after you till you're big. Come on.  I'm glad I'm out. It was hot inside. It's your own fault. The others came out long ago. What made you wait so long? I had a beautiful dream. A dream? But Maya bees never dream. Perhaps someday I'll tell you what I dreamt. It was such fun. What happens now? Shall I jump or are you coming to fetch me? Wait. I'll fetch you. Don't worry. You're quite safe. Come along. Your life is just a dream.  It's beginning and there's so much to learn. Oh, what are they doing? They're learning to fly in a swarm. Swarm? What's that? We bees always fly in a swarm. I don't understand. It's a little difficult to understand. I'll teach you easier things first. I hope so. And why do they do that? We bees have done that ever since we began a long time ago. And why do bees do this? Why don't you tell me, Miss?  Cassandra, I want to know why. How am I ever going to learn anything about life if you won't tell me about things? Be patient, Maya. I can't explain everything to you at once. Come, let's join the others. All right. And in the comb they put the eggs. Why do they do that? The eggs line the comb like bird's eggs in their nest, and after a few weeks of  little bees hatch, just as you did. Was I in an egg like that? Yes, you were. Watch how they put an egg in each little hole, and then another bee comes and shuts it tight with wax. They are the worker bees. They only work inside the hive. They build the hive and look after the eggs. They're very busy, for the queen lays a lot of eggs every day. I don't suppose you can remember when you were a queen bee.  You were inside an egg, do you? Goodness! What is that child up to now? Oh! So heavy! I've managed it! Oh, there you are!  See, Miss Cassandra, I can do it as well. Good, but only one egg in each hole. But why? If there were two eggs together, they could talk to each other. They wouldn't be so lonely, would they? Maya, we bees weren't born to spend our days talking. We were born to work. I worry about you. You really have such funny ideas in your little head. I like my idea, two eggs instead of one. My dear Maya, experience has proved that one egg is better.  But why is it better? We could make much bigger combs for bigger eggs. Come along. Let's get along. Oh, that smells good. What is it? I'm hungry. It is good. That's honey that you can smell.  Why can't I move this as the others can?  Leave that. It's too heavy for you. Is that all honey? Yes. We store the honey for the winter in here. Hmm. Maya, come back here at once. Oh, it's lovely, Miss Cassandra. Oh, oh, oh! Oh, oh, oh!  Goodness, you are a naughty child. What a mess you're in, Maya, really. Honey, it tastes nice, but it's so sticky... Come along. School is beginning. ...as I move my wings. Now you're old enough, I'm going to take you on a trip to the outside world to see the sky. Miss Cassandra, will you...  Would you please tell me what the sky is? I want to know. Just wait until we get there, then I'll explain everything to you. But don't think it's all fun out there. Little bees aren't allowed out there on their own. Do you understand? Oh. Huh? It's dangerous out there. You must understand how wicked it is and be very careful. Yes, I know that, Miss Cassandra, because I've been in this class for two years already. Then you should know that this is a wasp and they're our worst enemies. They're ten times bigger than we are, so be very careful.  careful of them. There's no need to be afraid. Now get back to your seats. There are no wasps inside the hive. They can't get in. So you really needn't be scared at all, my little ones. This is a frog. Never fly too low over water because that's what might happen. He's got a very long tongue. Don't worry. A frog can never get in here. And Cassandra, does that mean we must never, never go near  where there are any frogs. Correct, Willie. Don't forget. Are you Willie? Yeah, I'm Willie. You seem to be very clever. No, it's just that I've heard this lesson for years. Well, I am Maya. Have you heard about me? Yes, but only terrible things. You ask people so many questions, they want to scream. The world can be a very cruel place. For example, when it rains, it isn't at all nice. When that happens, come back home or hide under a leaf. No!  it's raining outside, what's the best thing for a little bee to do? Will he? Do you know? Well, he should stay at home. What would happen if he didn't stay at home, Miss Cassandra? My dear child, I've just told you. What's that terrible noise? Please stay at your desks. I'll be back very soon. What's the matter? I wonder what's happening. Something must be wrong. Am I?  Maya, Maya, where are you going? Come back. I'm going outside. No, Maya, Maya, come back. It isn't safe to go outside. What are you doing? Give it to me.  Stop whining. It belongs to Miss Cassandra. Oh, my goodness. Where does this voice come from? You be quiet. Someone's coming. What's going on here? Stop crying. It's not so bad. You others keep quiet. Willie, you and the others keep order here.  You heard what he said. I'm in charge. You must do as I say. Look! A horse! That's not a real one. It's the one we saw before. It's only a picture. But since I'm in charge, I'll show you something else.  This is a spider, isn't he ugly? He's dangerous too. I saw a real one. Her name was Martha and you know what? She played the fiddle. No, it isn't. This is a dandelion. Oh, even a teacher can make a mistake.   There's a strong wind blowing outside, and it isn't at all nice. The sky isn't blue anymore. Miss Cassandra said it was beautiful. The sky isn't blue anymore.  I wonder what flower that is. What's going on in here? Oh, Miss Cassandra! Willie, what are you doing here? Didn't I tell you all to stay at your desks and keep quiet? I was. Thank you, Willie. Now you go back to your desk, too. Maya, can you tell me what this is? Oh, where is she?  Does anybody know where she is? Did anybody see her going out? Yes, I saw her going out. I know exactly where she's gone. She wanted to see the storm. Oh, no! What a naughty child she is. I have to watch her all the time, the silly girl. The world is looking beautiful again. Oh, there's that funny little blue man again.  come on out give me your hand and dance with me sing with me jump with me sing and play and have some fun and laugh with me come on out give me your hand right now wow  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la Like a carousel I turn around and round Round and round  Round and round, one and one and two and three, such fun with me. Turn around, I'll show you why. You will understand. This is wonderful. When we dance, the trees and flowers spin around. Come on now, give me your hand and dance with me.  with me, sing with me, jump with me, sing and play and have some fun with me, come and dance, jump with me.  Left leg up and right leg up and dance with me. One, two, three. Like a carousel we go round and round. Round and round. Round and round. Come and have some fun with me. Very, very good. Maya, Maya.  Maya, where are you? Maya, where are you? Maya, answer me at once. It's your teacher, Miss Cassandra. Maya, where are you? Maya. I saw it happen. I'm telling you. You're always in luck. What's wrong? Have you seen a little bee? If you're looking for that naughty little girl, she's over there. Let her stay there for a few minutes and learn a good lesson. Maya! Is that you, Miss Cassandra? I should sting you now. Now that you're trapped.  You've been very naughty, Maya. I'm going to have to punish you and send you to bed straight away. Oh, I didn't do anything bad. I just wanted to explore. It doesn't matter. You caused me a lot of trouble. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And don't go exploring again. Yes, I'm sorry. Okay. Now, just lie there quiet.  and go to sleep. Oof. Why is it naughty of me to want to see the outside world? Next time I'll be clever and run away when nobody's looking. Then they'll never find me. This was our first story about bees. I hope you'll be watching next time because if you are, I'll tell you a little secret. Secret?  Next time we meet, you'll see how big Maya has grown. She's ready to learn to fly, but not alone. Miss Cassandra is with her to see that she keeps out of trouble. Bye-bye. Be seeing you.  \u00a9 BF-WATCH TV 2021  \u00a9 BF-WATCH TV 2021",

Maya, where are you? Maya, where are you? Maya, answer me at once. It's your teacher, Miss Cassandra. Maya, where are you? Maya. I saw it happen. I'm telling you. You're always in luck. What's wrong? Have you seen a little bee? If you're looking for that naughty little girl, she's over there. Let her stay there for a few minutes and learn a good lesson. Maya! Is that you, Miss Cassandra? I should sting you now. Now that you're trapped. You've been very naughty, Maya. I'm going to have to punish you and send you to bed straight away. Oh, I didn't do anything bad. I just wanted to explore. It doesn't matter. You caused me a lot of trouble. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And don't go exploring again. Yes, I'm sorry. Okay. Now, just lie there quiet. and go to sleep. Oof. Why is it naughty of me to want to see the outside world? Next time I'll be clever and run away when nobody's looking. Then they'll never find me. This was our first story about bees. I hope you'll be watching next time because if you are, I'll tell you a little secret. Secret? Next time we meet, you'll see how big Maya has grown. She's ready to learn to fly, but not alone. Miss Cassandra is with her to see that she keeps out of trouble. Bye-bye. Be seeing you. \u00a9 BF-WATCH TV 2021 \u00a9 BF-WATCH TV 2021"

Mas a sua teoria faz sentido pra mim. N\u00e3o podemos perder tempo. Temos que come\u00e7ar a investigar isso agora. O qu\u00ea? T\u00e1 falando s\u00e9rio agora? Claro. Voc\u00ea contou isso pra mais algu\u00e9m? N\u00e3o. Voc\u00ea \u00e9 a primeira pessoa pra quem eu conto. Voc\u00ea tem muita sorte, mas como vai se livrar dela? Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o pode fazer isso aqui. Rio, que tem o dom de dizer o \u00f3bvio. Como se eu n\u00e3o soubesse. Vamos come\u00e7ar. Pode, por favor, me dizer a data e a hora do seu trabalho?  sequestro do \u00f4nibus? Foi em 20 de dezembro, em frente a Azaghal Rio, \u00e0s 11h02 da manh\u00e3, seguindo para Space Land. 20 de dezembro. E eles estavam a caminho do Space Land, n\u00e3o \u00e9? \u00c9. Assim, ningu\u00e9m vai encontrar o corpo. E se encontrarem, v\u00e3o supor que a morte...  A morte do noivo a levou ao suic\u00eddio. Olha a gra\u00e7a, Ryuki. Desculpe interrogar voc\u00eas dessa maneira, mas n\u00e3o tive outra escolha. Eu comprovei que Kira n\u00e3o est\u00e1 entre n\u00f3s. Ryuzaki, como pode ter certeza de que somos inocentes? Bom, para ser sincero, desde o in\u00edcio eu armei v\u00e1rias armadilhas que reviveram.  revelariam se algum de voc\u00eas \u00e9 o Kira. Mas depois de falar com cada um, n\u00e3o senti necessidade. Com licen\u00e7a. Incr\u00edvel. A gente teve que desligar o celular. Entendido. Estou quase terminando aqui mesmo. Voc\u00ea tem a chave, ent\u00e3o entre. O Atari est\u00e1 vindo pra c\u00e1. Aham. Ent\u00e3o \u00e9 isso, n\u00e9? Eu quero contar tudo.  Tudo para o meu pai, se voc\u00ea concordar, \u00e9 claro. Olha, se der no mesmo, eu prefiro contar pessoalmente. Depois de conversar com voc\u00ea, decidi que \u00e9 melhor fazer isso o mais r\u00e1pido poss\u00edvel. \u00c9, faz sentido. S\u00f3 dez segundos at\u00e9 uma e quinze. Tenho que admitir, eu adoraria v\u00ea-la morrer. Mas n\u00e3o posso ser visto seguindo-a. Ah.  Anda. Corra para sua morte. Kira vai ser pego. Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o acha? O que est\u00e1 havendo? J\u00e1 devia ter acontecido.  Isso n\u00e3o faz sentido. N\u00e3o entendo por que ela n\u00e3o sai. N\u00e3o tive dificuldades em fazer as pessoas se matarem. Era s\u00f3 escrever a palavra suic\u00eddio. Os criminosos que testei se mataram do jeito que eu especifiquei. Meus testes indicam que numa situa\u00e7\u00e3o dessas, eu posso controlar os atos das pessoas. Ent\u00e3o, por qu\u00ea? Ryuki.  Ele riu assim quando eu estava escrevendo no Death Note. E n\u00e3o \u00e9 s\u00f3 isso. Eu lembro de achar estranho ele rir quando perguntei o nome dela. Na verdade, ele reagiu do mesmo jeito todas as vezes que eu disse o nome dela. Nome falso! Senhores, \u00e9 uma honra conhec\u00ea-los. \u00c9 esse o Atari?  Pela roupa, n\u00e3o parece. Se eu me vestisse assim, estaria me anunciando como o Atari. Seria o suficiente para expor a mim e Ryuzaki em nosso local de encontro. Ah, entendi. Geralmente, eu n\u00e3o mostraria meu rosto a nenhum de voc\u00eas. O fato de eu estar aqui \u00e9 que ganharam a confian\u00e7a de Ryuzaki. J\u00e1 que falou nisso, eu me sinto honrado. Ellie, eu trouxe o que pediu. Est\u00e1 tudo aqui. Pode pass\u00e1-los a todos, por favor?  Sim. Senhor, e suas novas identidades policiais? Mas, para qu\u00ea? Ela usou o nome falso. S\u00f3 pode ser isso. Riu que sabia. Ele viu o nome verdadeiro dela com seus olhos. Por isso, ele n\u00e3o parava de rir. Eu devia saber. Ela teve cuidado desde o in\u00edcio. Entendi. Faz sentido. Ela acredita que Ray morreu porque mostrou sua identidade ao Kira. Ent\u00e3o, claro que vai.  Vai tomar cuidado para n\u00e3o revelar o pr\u00f3prio nome. Isso n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada bom. Vai ser quase imposs\u00edvel perguntar o nome verdadeiro, sabendo que ela me deu um falso. Se eu for muito insistente, ela vai suspeitar. O que eu estou pensando? Vai parecer suspeito eu saber que ela usou um nome falso. Acho melhor eu voltar agora. Algu\u00e9m da For\u00e7a-Tarefa j\u00e1 pode ter chegado. Ah, \u00e9 mesmo. Pode ser. Vamos cruzar os dedos e esperar que algu\u00e9m esteja l\u00e1.  Erra. Droga, estou ficando sem op\u00e7\u00f5es. Eu tenho que impedir isso antes que seja tarde demais. Ah, n\u00e3o. E se o meu pai ligar agora? Eu j\u00e1 prometi que deixaria ela falar com ele. Se esse telefone tocar, eu estou acabado. O que eu vou fazer? Isso \u00e9 loucura. \u00c9 s\u00f3 desligar o telefone.  Eu vou tirar o celular. Problema resolvido. Agora, calma. Voc\u00ea sabe o que tem que fazer. Descobrir o nome verdadeiro dela. A bolsa, os bolsos... Ela deve ter uma carteira de motorista ou uma identidade em algum lugar. Ela \u00e9 uma mulher. Se fosse preciso, eu poderia usar a for\u00e7a. N\u00e3o. A \u00faltima coisa que eu preciso \u00e9 uma cena em p\u00fablico. Eu tenho que peg\u00e1-la isoladamente. Mas onde? Em que explica\u00e7\u00e3o eu daria? Nunca d\u00e1.  Ela \u00e9 muito cuidadosa. Preciso me aproximar melhor. Eu consigo. Vou convenc\u00ea-la a me dar seu nome verdadeiro. Light, n\u00e3o esque\u00e7a que meu acordo est\u00e1 sempre em aberto. \u00c9 como colocar lentes de contato. S\u00f3 leva uns segundos. Voc\u00ea acha que eu estaria pronto a abrir a m\u00e3o de metade da minha vida s\u00f3 para saber o nome verdadeiro dessa mulher? N\u00e3o. De jeito nenhum. Na verdade, nem vale a pena considerar. Agora, pare de pensar.  me fazer perder tempo. Cala a boca, Shinigami. Desculpa. Oi? Voc\u00ea ainda tem o que fazer l\u00e1 na pol\u00edcia? \u00c9 que eu prefiro entrar sozinha, se n\u00e3o se importar. Eu n\u00e3o me importo. Nossos nomes e patentes s\u00e3o falsos. Por que nos deu identidades falsas? Como sabem, Kira precisa de um nome e um rosto para matar. Vamos enfrent\u00e1-lo tendo isso em mente. E acho que fica \u00f3bvio o porqu\u00ea. Tudo bem, mas acho que a pol\u00edcia n\u00e3o deveria...  deveria usar identidade falsa. Chega! Que escolha n\u00f3s temos com as capacidades de nosso inimigo? Enquanto trabalharmos nesse caso, acho que vamos precisar de toda a prote\u00e7\u00e3o poss\u00edvel. Seria burrice n\u00e3o us\u00e1-la. \u00c9, acho que tem raz\u00e3o. Lembrem, quando estiverem numa situa\u00e7\u00e3o em que tiverem que dar seu nome a um estranho, usem os nomes de suas identidades falsas, entendido? Certo. E cuidado para n\u00e3o mostr\u00e1-las quando estiverem na presen\u00e7a de outros policiais. Sei que n\u00e3o preciso dizer isso, mas isso pode causar problemas para  Entendo. Muito bem. Ent\u00e3o eu quero pedir que todos voc\u00eas usem isso o tempo todo. Ah, cintos? Cada um tem um transmissor escondido na fivela. Isso vai permitir que Ryuzaki monitore seu paradeiro. Quando apertam a fivela duas vezes assim, meu celular toca mostrando seu nome. E eu ligo imediatamente, mas voc\u00eas n\u00e3o ver\u00e3o meu n\u00famero no seu telefone. De manh\u00e3, todos voc\u00eas ir\u00e3o ao trabalho como sempre.  Depois, mais tarde, vamos usar esse m\u00e9todo para confirmar o nome do hotel do Ryuzaki e seu quarto. Por favor, usem isso tamb\u00e9m para emerg\u00eancias. Gente, isso \u00e9 muito maneiro. Eu me sinto um super agente secreto atr\u00e1s do Kira. Cala essa boca. Isso n\u00e3o \u00e9 hora de bobagem, Matsuda. Para com isso. Sim, senhor. Muito obrigada por tudo que fez, Light. Depois de falar com voc\u00ea, me sinto bem mais confiante sobre a minha teoria. Que bom.  Considerando que Ryuki mencionou de novo a hist\u00f3ria dos olhos, n\u00e3o tenho d\u00favidas de que ela usou o nome falso. Assim, quando ela for \u00e0 pol\u00edcia com sua teoria sobre o Kira no \u00f4nibus e eles olharem todas as pessoas que Ray Pember investigou, n\u00e3o vai demorar para que cheguem a mim. A\u00ed, l\u00e1 vai ela. O que voc\u00ea vai fazer? Tem uns cinco minutos at\u00e9 que essa mulher chegue ao pr\u00e9dio da pol\u00edcia.  Pensa, preciso do nome dela e n\u00e3o tenho tempo a perder. Se essa mulher chegar \u00e0 pol\u00edcia e algu\u00e9m da for\u00e7a-tarefa tiver voltado, estou acabado. Tenho que descobrir o nome dela e mat\u00e1-la r\u00e1pido. S\u00f3 mais tr\u00eas minutos.  minutos at\u00e9 ela chegar ent\u00e3o t\u00e1 l\u00e1 vai e a\u00ed vai fazer o que oi d\u00e1 licen\u00e7a fala tem uma coisa que eu devia te contar t\u00e1 bom \u00e9 que vai ser imposs\u00edvel voc\u00ea entrar em contato com algu\u00e9m da for\u00e7a tarefa diretamente isso mesmo continua conversa s\u00f3 preciso achar alguma coisa que ela possa se agarrar e eu pego quando ela estiver mais \u00e0 vontade eu descubro o nome verdadeiro  Eu consigo. Ainda n\u00e3o entendi. Como assim? N\u00e3o achou estranho n\u00e3o ter ningu\u00e9m no quartel-general da For\u00e7a-Tarefa? \u00c9, eu achei um pouco estranho, sim. Eu vou explicar. A For\u00e7a-Tarefa foi organizada para que seus agentes n\u00e3o fossem identificados e ningu\u00e9m de fora soubesse quem est\u00e1 encarregado. Se os nomes dos agentes se tornarem p\u00fablicos ou a estrutura da For\u00e7a-Tarefa for revelada, podemos ver mais uma trag\u00e9dia como aquela que tirou a vida do seu noivo no metr\u00f4.  \u00c9 verdade. Por isso disseram a voc\u00ea que ningu\u00e9m estava no quartel-general da For\u00e7a-Tarefa. O que eu estou querendo dizer \u00e9 que voc\u00ea nunca vai poder falar diretamente com algu\u00e9m da For\u00e7a-Tarefa porque a pol\u00edcia n\u00e3o vai permitir. Muito esperto. Impressionante. Se deveria ser segredo, como voc\u00ea sabe tanto? Acho que falecido de paz. Ela \u00e9 muito esperta. Claro.  T\u00e1 legal. Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o me deixa escolha. \u00c9 porque eu sou um membro da For\u00e7a-Tarefa tamb\u00e9m. Pera\u00ed, voc\u00ea t\u00e1 dizendo que \u00e9 um agente? Isso mesmo. Ele atualmente comanda a For\u00e7a-Tarefa e lidera a nossa investiga\u00e7\u00e3o. Eu sei. Pra ser sincera, eu j\u00e1 tinha suspeitado. Ele se preocupou que a For\u00e7a-Tarefa diminu\u00edsse muito. V\u00e1rios detetives se demitiram da For\u00e7a-Tarefa com medo de morrer. Ent\u00e3o, apesar do fato de eu ser um estudante, ele decidiu me incluir pra ajudar na investiga\u00e7\u00e3o.  Afinal, eu j\u00e1 ajudei eles a resolver outros casos. Quer dizer que Ellie confia em voc\u00ea? Eu posso ir ao quartel-general da For\u00e7a-Tarefa quando quiser. E posso investigar livremente o que eu quiser. Sabe de uma coisa? Hoje a For\u00e7a-Tarefa \u00e9 formada por poucos escolhidos. Um grupo de elite de gente escolhida a dedo pelo Ellie. Todos altamente habilitados, respeitados e, acima de tudo, confi\u00e1veis.  Obrigada pela explica\u00e7\u00e3o. Mas pra ter certeza, eu quero tentar de novo ir ao quartel-general da For\u00e7a-Tarefa. Tchau. Por favor, espera um pouco. Foi o que eu disse. N\u00e3o v\u00e3o deixar voc\u00ea falar com ningu\u00e9m no quartel. Eu sei, mas esperava falar diretamente com o L. O que \u00e9 isso?  Est\u00e1 na pol\u00edcia agora. Na verdade, n\u00e3o tem ningu\u00e9m l\u00e1 agora. Isso n\u00e3o \u00e9 bom. Precisamos de algu\u00e9m l\u00e1 o tempo todo, trabalhando em turno se for preciso. Positivo. Aizawa, voc\u00ea ser\u00e1 o respons\u00e1vel por isso hoje. Sim, senhor. Eu estou indo e n\u00e3o vou demorar. Senhorita Maki, por favor, um segundo. \u00c9 literalmente imposs\u00edvel encontrar Ellie. N\u00e3o vai adiantar. Voc\u00ea deve ter raz\u00e3o. Mas eu acho que tenho uma chance dele me encontrar.  Eu s\u00f3 tive contato com ele seguindo ordens por computador, mas ele deve lembrar quem eu sou. Eu trabalhei pra ele num caso nos Estados Unidos h\u00e1 uns dois anos. \u00c9 s\u00e9rio? Voc\u00ea j\u00e1 trabalhou pro L? \u00c9, eu nunca conto isso, mas at\u00e9 tr\u00eas meses eu era agente do FBI. Finalmente, \u00e9 isso. Alguma coisa que eu possa usar. Eu n\u00e3o devia me surpreender. Na verdade, percebi que sua habilidade investigativa era boa demais pra um amador.  Voc\u00ea tem bastante cuidado e parece ter o dom de ir ao fundo da quest\u00e3o. Se eu pudesse, gostaria de aprender com voc\u00ea. Uma mentira depois da outra. Como isso \u00e9 f\u00e1cil para voc\u00ea? Eu sempre soube que tinha que fazer as coisas por fora dos canais regulares, porque do meu ponto de vista, tanto a pol\u00edcia quanto os membros da For\u00e7a Tarefa eram suspeitos. Mas eu sei que posso confiar no L. Talvez seja irreal, mas eu achei que se eu viesse pessoalmente e desse o meu nome, tinha chance de me deixarem falar comigo.  Eu falei com ele diretamente. Entendi. Mas se a \u00fanica pessoa que voc\u00ea pode confiar \u00e9 o Ellie, por que falou comigo? Acho que eu estava chateada por n\u00e3o me deixarem ver ningu\u00e9m da For\u00e7a-Tarefa. E a\u00ed voc\u00ea apareceu dizendo ser filho do detetive-chefe. Ent\u00e3o, n\u00e3o. N\u00e3o foi nada disso. Vou ser sincera. \u00c9 porque voc\u00ea me lembrou o Ellie. Voc\u00ea tem alguma coisa que \u00e9 igual a ele.  Quero investigar o caso comigo. H\u00e3? Quero que venha trabalhar conosco como parte da For\u00e7a-Tarefa. Precisamos de sua ajuda. Como deve saber, n\u00e3o \u00e9 qualquer um que pode fazer isso. Por favor, eu sei que \u00e9 repentino, mas a equipe precisa de gente como voc\u00ea. \u00c9 s\u00e9rio, voc\u00ea pode fazer bem mais que unir informa\u00e7\u00f5es sozinha. Voc\u00ea tem toda a experi\u00eancia como agente do FBI e \u00e9 mais talentosa que a maioria dos agentes atuantes.  atualmente na For\u00e7a-Tarefa e o Ellie obviamente confiou em voc\u00ea no passado. N\u00e3o vai ser t\u00e3o dif\u00edcil voc\u00ea se juntar. S\u00f3 preciso de uma identifica\u00e7\u00e3o v\u00e1lida, uma recomenda\u00e7\u00e3o de um membro atual da For\u00e7a-Tarefa e precisa ter a permiss\u00e3o do Ellie. Quer que eu entre na For\u00e7a-Tarefa? S\u00f3 consigo pensar que deve ter sido o destino que me trouxe voc\u00ea hoje. Eu quero recomendar voc\u00ea ao Ellie. Ai, t\u00e1. Me desculpa. Eu acho que eu me empolguei demais, n\u00e3o foi? N\u00e3o.  Tudo bem. Mesmo se agisse como consultora nessa investiga\u00e7\u00e3o, seria de grande ajuda. Eu tenho certeza de que voc\u00ea tem obriga\u00e7\u00f5es pessoais. Al\u00e9m do fato de voc\u00ea viver nos Estados Unidos. \u00c9 verdade. Antes disso tudo acontecer, eu planejava continuar l\u00e1 com o meu noivo. N\u00f3s \u00edamos casar na primavera. Mas agora que ele morreu, eu n\u00e3o sei mais o que fazer. Est\u00e1 \u00f3timo. Cheguei at\u00e9 aqui. Ela s\u00f3 precisa de um empurr\u00e3ozinho. Mas voc\u00ea \u00e9 jovem, bonita, tem uma vida inteira pela frente. Por que colocar a sua vida em perigo?  N\u00e3o! Agora que o Ray morreu, eu n\u00e3o tenho mais nada a perder. Eu quero pegar o Kira. Nada mais me importa. \u00c9 tudo o que eu quero fazer. Por favor, deixe-me investigar esse caso com voc\u00ea. Claro, com certeza. Eu s\u00f3 preciso de uma identifica\u00e7\u00e3o pessoal antes de continuarmos. Ah, t\u00e1... O que foi? Sabe o nome que eu te dei hoje?  N\u00e3o \u00e9 meu nome de verdade. Me desculpe. N\u00e3o se preocupe, tudo bem. Pra ser sincero, estou impressionado de como voc\u00ea foi cuidadosa. Na realidade, voc\u00ea ficou um passo na minha frente. Eu acho que isso s\u00f3 prova as suas capacidades. Ent\u00e3o, uma carteira de motorista japonesa serve? Serve.  Bem na hora. N\u00e3o.  Por que voc\u00ea olha tanto o rel\u00f3gio? Ah, sim. Eu acho que \u00e9 porque... Porque eu sou o Kira.  O que \u00e9 o problema? Eu preciso fazer uma coisa. O celular do meu pai j\u00e1 est\u00e1 dispon\u00edvel agora. Quer ver se consegue falar com ele? N\u00e3o, obrigada. N\u00e3o tenho nada a dizer para ele.

        "translated": "In the spreading darkness, we exchanged words of wisdom. We can't let anyone fool us, so the quest tells us  Next Episode What are you doing? But your theory makes sense to me. We can't waste any time. We have to start investigating this now. What? Are you serious now? Of course. Have you told anyone else about this? No. You're the first person I've told. You're very lucky, but how are you going to get rid of it? You can't do that here. Rio, who has a gift for stating the obvious. As if I didn't know. Let's get started. Can you please tell me the date and time of your work? bus hijacking? It was on December 20th, in front of Azaghal Rio, at 11:02 in the morning, heading to Space Land. December 20th. And they were on their way to Space Land, right? Yeah. So no one will find the body. And if they do, they'll assume that the death... Her fianc\u00e9's death led her to commit suicide. How funny is that, Ryuki. I'm sorry to interrogate you like this, but I had no other choice. I've proven that Kira is not among us. Ryuzaki, how can you be sure that we are innocent? Well, to be honest, from the beginning I set several traps that revived. would reveal if any of you are Kira. But after talking to each one of you, I didn't feel the need. Excuse me. Awesome. We had to turn off our phones. Understood. I'm almost done here. You have the key, so come on in. Atari is on his way here. Yeah. So that's it, huh? I want to tell you everything. All for my father, if you agree, of course. Look, if it comes to the same thing, I'd rather tell you in person. After talking to you, I've decided it's best to do this as quickly as possible. Yeah, that makes sense. Just ten seconds until a quarter past one. I have to admit, I'd love to see her die. But I can't be seen following her. Oh. Come on. Run to your death. Kira will be caught. Don't you think so? What's going on? It should have happened already. That doesn't make sense. I don't understand why she won't leave. I had no trouble making people kill themselves. I just had to write the word suicide. The criminals I tested killed themselves the way I specified. My tests indicate that in a situation like that, I can control people's actions. So why? Ryuki. He laughed like that when I was writing in the Death Note. And that's not all. I remember thinking it was weird that he laughed when I asked her name. In fact, he reacted the same way every time I said her name. Fake name! Gentlemen, it's an honor to meet you. Is this Atari? From what you're wearing, it doesn't look like it. If I dressed like that, I'd be announcing myself as Atari. It would be enough to expose me and Ryuzaki at our meeting place. Ah, I see. Normally, I wouldn't show my face to any of you. The fact that I'm here is how you've earned Ryuzaki's trust. Since you mentioned it, I feel honored. Ellie, I brought what you asked for. It's all here. Could you pass it out to everyone, please? Yes. Sir, what about your new police IDs? But what for? She used the fake name. That's the only thing she could do. She laughed because she knew. He saw her real name with his eyes. That's why he couldn't stop laughing. I should have known. She was careful from the start. I get it. It makes sense. She believes Ray died because she showed Kira her ID. So, of course she will. You'll be careful not to reveal your own name. That's not good. It'll be almost impossible to ask her real name, knowing that she gave me a fake one. If I'm too persistent, she'll get suspicious. What am I thinking? It'll look suspicious if I know she used a fake name. I think I'd better go back now. Someone from the Task Force might have arrived already. Oh, right. Maybe. Let's cross our fingers and hope someone is there. Wrong. Damn, I'm running out of options. I have to stop this before it's too late. Oh no. What if my dad calls now? I already promised I'd let her talk to him. If this phone rings, I'm done. What am I going to do? This is crazy. Just hang up the phone. I'll take the cell phone. Problem solved. Now, calm down. You know what you have to do. Find out her real name. Her purse, her pockets... She must have a driver's license or an ID somewhere. She's a woman. If necessary, I could use force. No. The last thing I need is a public scene. I have to catch her alone. But where? What explanation would I give? It never works. She's very careful. I need to get closer. I can do it. I'll convince her to give me her real name. Light, remember that my deal is always open. It's like putting on contact lenses. It only takes a few seconds. Do you think I'd be willing to give up half my life just to know this woman's real name? No. No way. In fact, it's not even worth considering. Now, stop thinking. wasting my time. Shut up, Shinigami. Sorry. Hey? Do you still have business at the police station? I'd rather go in alone, if you don't mind. I don't mind. Our names and ranks are fake. Why did you give us fake identities? As you know, Kira needs a name and a face to kill. Let's face it with that in mind. And I think it's obvious why. Okay, but I don't think the police should... should use a fake ID. Enough! What choice do we have with the capabilities of our enemy? As long as we work this case, I think we're going to need all the protection we can get. It would be foolish not to use it. Yeah, I think you're right. Remember, when you're in a situation where you have to give your name to a stranger, use the names on your fake IDs, okay? Okay. And be careful not to show them around other officers. I know I don't have to say this, but it could get you in trouble. I see. Very well. Then I would like to ask that all of you wear these at all times. Oh, belts? Each one has a transmitter hidden in the buckle. This will allow Ryuzaki to monitor your whereabouts. When you fasten the buckle twice like this, my cell phone will ring showing your name. And I will call you immediately, but you will not see my number on your phone. In the morning, all of you will go to work as usual. Later on, we'll use this method to confirm the name of Ryuzaki's hotel and his room. Please use this for emergencies as well. Guys, this is really cool. I feel like a super secret agent after Kira. Shut up. This is no time for nonsense, Matsuda. Stop it. Yes, sir. Thank you very much for everything you did, Light. After talking to you, I feel much more confident about my theory. That's great. Considering Ryuki brought up the eye thing again, I have no doubt she used the fake name. So when she goes to the police with her theory about Kira on the bus and they look at all the people Ray Pember investigated, it won't be long before they get to me. Then there she goes. What are you going to do? You have about five minutes until this woman gets to the police building. Think about it, I need her name and I don't have time to waste. If this woman gets to the police and someone from the task force is back, I'm done. I have to find out her name and kill her fast. Just three more minutes. minutes until she arrives, so there you go, and then you're going to do what you want. Hi, excuse me, there's something I should tell you, okay? It's that it's going to be impossible for you to contact anyone from the task force directly. That's right, keep talking. I just need to find something she can hold on to and I'll get it when she's more comfortable. I'll find out her real name. I can. I still don't get it. What do you mean? Didn't you find it strange that there was no one at the Task Force headquarters? Yeah, I did find it a little strange. Let me explain. The Task Force was organized so that its agents could not be identified and no one on the outside would know who was in charge. If the names of the agents were made public or the structure of the Task Force was revealed, we could see another tragedy like the one that took the life of your fianc\u00e9 on the subway. That's right. That's why they told you that no one was at the Task Force headquarters. What I'm trying to say is that you'll never be able to talk directly to anyone from the Task Force because the police won't allow it. Very clever. Impressive. If it's supposed to be a secret, how do you know so much? I think she's dead. She's very clever. Of course. Okay. You don't give me a choice. It's because I'm a member of the Task Force too. Wait, are you saying you're an agent? That's right. He's currently in charge of the Task Force and leading our investigation. I know. To be honest, I had my suspicions. He was worried that the Task Force would shrink too much. Several detectives had resigned from the Task Force out of fear of their lives. So, despite the fact that I was a student, he decided to include me to help with the investigation. After all, I've helped them solve other cases. Does that mean Ellie trusts you? I can come to the Task Force headquarters whenever I want. And I can investigate whatever I want freely. You know what? Today, the Task Force is made up of a select few. An elite group of people handpicked by Ellie. All highly skilled, respected, and, above all, trustworthy. Thank you for the explanation. But to be sure, I want to try again to go to the Task Force headquarters. Bye. Please wait a bit. That's what I said. They won't let you talk to anyone at the headquarters. I know, but I was hoping to talk to L. directly. What's this? He's at the police station now. In fact, there's no one there right now. That's not good. We need someone there at all times, working shifts if necessary. Positive. Aizawa, you'll be in charge of that today. Yes, sir. I'm coming and I won't be long. Miss Maki, please just a second. It's literally impossible to find Ellie. It's no use. You're probably right. But I think I have a chance of him finding me. I've only had contact with him through computer commands, but he must remember who I am. I worked for him on a case in the States about two years ago. Seriously? Did you ever work for L? Yeah, I never tell people this, but up until three months ago I was an FBI agent. Finally, this is it. Something I can use. I shouldn't be surprised. In fact, I realized his investigative skills were too good for an amateur. You're very careful and seem to have a knack for getting to the bottom of things. If I could, I'd like to learn from you. One lie after another. How is this easy for you? I always knew I had to do things outside of regular channels, because from my perspective, both the police and the Task Force members were suspects. But I know I can trust L. Maybe it's unrealistic, but I figured if I came forward in person and gave my name, I had a chance they'd let me talk to them. I spoke to him directly. I get it. But if the only person you can trust is Ellie, why did you speak to me? I guess I was just upset that they wouldn't let me see anyone on the Task Force. And then you showed up claiming to be the son of the lead detective. So, no. It wasn't like that at all. I'll be honest. It's because you reminded me of Ellie. There's something about you that's just like him. I want to investigate the case with me. Huh? I want you to come work with us as part of the Task Force. We need your help. As you know, not just anyone can do this. Please, I know it's sudden, but the team needs people like you. Seriously, you can do a lot more than just gather information on your own. You have all the experience as an FBI agent and you're more talented than most of the agents out there. You're currently on the Task Force, and Ellie has obviously trusted you in the past. It shouldn't be that hard for you to join. All I need is a valid ID, a recommendation from a current Task Force member, and you need to have Ellie's permission. Do you want me to join the Task Force? All I can think of is that it must have been fate that brought you to me today. I want to recommend you to Ellie. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I guess I got a little carried away, didn't I? No. Okay. Even if you were to act as a consultant in this investigation, it would be a great help. I'm sure you have personal obligations. Besides the fact that you live in the United States. It's true. Before all this happened, I was planning to stay there with my fianc\u00e9. We were going to get married in the spring. But now that he's dead, I don't know what to do anymore. It's great. I've come this far. She just needs a little push. But you're young, beautiful, and have your whole life ahead of you. Why put your life in danger? No! Now that Ray is dead, I have nothing left to lose. I want to catch Kira. Nothing else matters to me. That's all I want to do. Please let me investigate this case with you. Sure, of course. I just need some personal identification before we continue. Oh, okay... What's up? Do you know the name I gave you today? It's not my real name. I'm sorry. Don't worry, it's fine. To be honest, I'm impressed by how careful you were. In fact, you were one step ahead of me. I guess that just proves your capabilities. So, will a Japanese driver's license do? It will. Right on time. No. Why do you look at your watch so much? Oh, yeah. I think it's because... Because I'm Kira. What's the problem? I need to do something. My dad's cell phone is available now. Do you want to see if you can reach him? No, thanks. I have nothing to say to him. So goodbye, Naomi Misora. sameme ... Thank you for watching WHY ME AND US With Ryuki's information I can continue killing criminals whose names are broadcast on the news while hiding like a typical innocent student studying for tests. Watch him."

Un bosquecito de abedules, avellano, rosa de azafr\u00e1n. Adelante. Unos arvitos de jugo de plantas. Por las ma\u00f1anas es un placer delicioso. Buenos d\u00edas, se\u00f1oras. \u00bfTrabajando tan temprano? No, las v\u00edas a\u00e9reas est\u00e1n muy...  ocupadas esta ma\u00f1ana por lo que veo. \u00a1Oh, claro! Una abeja reina. Por eso hay tanto jaleo. Las abejas est\u00e1n de fiesta.  Oh!  \u00a1Vamos! \u00a1Vamos! \u00a1Vamos! \u00a1R\u00e1pido! \u00a1R\u00e1pido! \u00a1Los panales se est\u00e1n derritiendo! \u00a1Vamos! \u00a1Todo el mundo a los panales! \u00a1Que se est\u00e1 saliendo la miel! \u00a1Vamos! \u00a1Vamos! \u00a1Vamos! \u00a1R\u00e1pido!  \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 gritan tanto? \u00a1Eh, Willy! \u00a1Espera! \u00bfQu\u00e9 est\u00e1s haciendo aqu\u00ed, Willy? Pues lo mismo que los dem\u00e1s, agitando mis alas. \u00a1Qu\u00e9 tonter\u00eda! \u00bfPara qu\u00e9? Vaya, har\u00e9 como si no hubiera o\u00eddo eso. Hab\u00eda desesperado.  demasiadas abejas en la colmena, demasiado calor y ten\u00edan que enjambrar. Ahora lo que tenemos que hacer es crear una corriente de aire. Cuando hace demasiado calor, la cera se derrite en los panales y los huevos y las larvas se mueren, \u00bfentiendes? \u00a1Eh, Maya! \u00bfA d\u00f3nde vas? Qu\u00e9date aqu\u00ed, a\u00fan no vamos a aprender a volar. Ya lo s\u00e9, pero cuando muevo mis alas no puedo evitarlo.  I'm sorry.  \u00a1Bien! \u00a1Bien! \u00a1Aj\u00e1! \u00a1Aj\u00e1! Bueno, lo han hecho otra vez. Creo que est\u00e1n un poco chifladas. Bueno, a m\u00ed me da lo mismo. En mi peque\u00f1o agujero en la tierra la temperatura es agradable, pero ellas tienen que construir una colmena con miles y miles de habitaciones. \u00a1No, vaya! \u00a1Silencio en el \u00faltimo banco! \u00a1Silencio en el \u00faltimo banco!  siempre al acecho en la oscuridad. Por eso una abeja no debe nunca salir de la colmena por la noche, no lo olvid\u00e9is. Se\u00f1orita, \u00bfpuedo hacer una pregunta? S\u00ed, \u00bfqu\u00e9 es, Maya? \u00bfCu\u00e1ndo podremos salir por fin de aqu\u00ed y volarnos? La prometida hace ya m\u00e1s de una semana. Exactamente. Un viejo proverbio dice, la experiencia es la madre de la ciencia. No seas tan impertinente. Cuando llegue la hora, saldr\u00e9is a volar. \u00bfY cu\u00e1ndo llegar\u00e1 esa hora, eh? Y adem\u00e1s, \u00bfqu\u00e9 quiere decir con eso de cuando llegue la hora? Quiero decir que ser\u00e1 esta misma tarde.  \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya! Maya va a volar, Maya va a volar. Ahora Maya va a volar. Ahora Maya va a volar, va a volar. \u00a1Maya! Lo siento. \u00bfNo puedes mirar por donde vas? Es que estoy muy nerviosa. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 me van a dejar volar por primera vez? Es estupendo. \u00bfY sabes una cosa? Volar\u00e9 directamente hacia el sol. \u00a1Maya va a volar! \u00a1Maya!  Yo recuerdo muy bien mi primer vuelo. Dios m\u00edo, hace tanto tiempo ya. No os queremos enga\u00f1ar. Ahora vamos a volar, a volar, a volar. \u00a1Alto, alto! Es a m\u00ed. Dime, \u00bft\u00fa eres Willy, eh? No, yo soy Maya. Oh, pensaba que eras Willy. Anda, sigue, sigue, vete. \u00bfQu\u00e9 es lo que pasa con Willy? Nada, nada, t\u00fa sigue, peque\u00f1a. Vale, vale.  \u00a1Ah! \u00a1Ah! Bueno, \u00bfest\u00e1s aqu\u00ed? Cre\u00ed que estabas deseando volar. Y lo estoy. Pero antes ten\u00eda que contar a todo el mundo que hoy voy a volar por primera vez. \u00a1He cepillado mis alas! \u00a1Mire, mire c\u00f3mo brillan! Vamos, ni\u00f1os, empecemos. \u00a1Qu\u00e9 bien!  Quiz\u00e1s est\u00e9 un poco bajo, \u00bfno crees? Vamos, Maya, int\u00e9ntalo t\u00fa. Muy bien. \u00a1Socorro, socorro, socorro! \u00a1Ay, que me caigo! Eso pasa siempre que se quiere volar demasiado alto. \u00a1Qu\u00e9 raro! Aqu\u00ed falta alguien. \u00bfNo est\u00e1 Willy? \u00bfNo? \u00a1Qu\u00e9 gracioso! \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no se ha venido con nosotros a clase?  \u00bfSabe por qu\u00e9 no est\u00e1 aqu\u00ed, se\u00f1orita? Puede que est\u00e9 enfermo. Ah. \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya! Vete con los dem\u00e1s y no se ir\u00e1n  volando. Ya se han ido, Willy. \u00bfQu\u00e9? \u00bfEntonces por qu\u00e9 has vuelto? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9? Porque no ten\u00eda ganas de volar. Eso no es cierto. No me enga\u00f1es. Estabas loca por volar. Mucho m\u00e1s que nosotros. Es por mi culpa, P\u00eda. Por m\u00ed te has quedado atr\u00e1s. Porque yo no puedo volar por eso. No es verdad. \u00bfNo te has quedado aqu\u00ed por m\u00ed? \u00bfY qu\u00e9 importa por lo que me haya quedado? \u00bfNo quieres que te lea un cuento? Lo sab\u00edas, \u00bfverdad?  \u00bfSab\u00edas que yo ten\u00eda miedo a volar? Porque no s\u00e9 y por eso has vuelto. \u00bfQu\u00e9 idea se te mete en la cabeza? No es que me imagine que no s\u00e9 volar, es que no s\u00e9. El viejo proverbio de las abejas tiene raz\u00f3n. Un amigo es el m\u00e1s preciado tesoro. Parece que las abejitas hacen su primera salida hoy. No veo a Maya con ellas. A lo mejor la han encerrado otra vez. \u00bfQu\u00e9?  Siento curiosidad por saberlo. Preguntar\u00e9 a la se\u00f1orita Casandra. Esto lo va a hacer mirar dos veces, se\u00f1ora. Nosotros los saltamontes somos unos tipos inteligentes. \u00a1Qu\u00e9 mala educaci\u00f3n! \u00a1Dando saltos mortales cuando se est\u00e1!  hablando con una dama. \u00a1Ay, usted no me comprende, mi querida se\u00f1ora! Yo tengo la sangre ardiente y mucho temperamento, mucho temperamento, \u00f1a, \u00f1a, \u00f1a, \u00f1a. \u00a1Ay, nuestra peque\u00f1a Maya! Seguramente habr\u00e1 hecho ya alguna de las suyas. Es encantadora, pero muy traviesa, muy traviesa, \u00f1a, \u00f1a, \u00f1a, \u00f1a. \u00a1Bueno, bueno! \u00a1Bueno! \u00a1Uy! \u00a1Ah! Y ahora, un poquito de sopa de polio. \u00a1No, no, no! Esta te dar\u00e1 fuerzas para volar. No, puedo comer m\u00e1s bulla, reventar. \u00a1Cambiar m\u00e1s!  Vamos, a\u00fan puedes tomar otro plato de sopa. Venga, abre la boca. Ay, pero es que no puedo comer nada m\u00e1s. Empiezo a sentirme mal y muy pesado. \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa, Willy? \u00bfEs que no te encuentras bien? Ay, mi tripa est\u00e1 tan llena que reventar\u00e1. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 est\u00e1 tan llena tu tripa? Ay, Maya pensaba que no ten\u00eda bastantes cuantas para volar y tuve que comerme todo eso. Ay. Ay, ay. Ay, ay. Maya. Ay. Ay.  \u00a1Ah\u00ed viene mi peque\u00f1a amiga! \u00a1Enhorabuena por tu primer vuelo, Maya! Est\u00e1 tan preocupada que ni me oye. \u00a1Qu\u00e9 bien huele aqu\u00ed! Deben ser las flores. \u00bfNo son maravillosas? \u00a1Buenos d\u00edas, flores! \u00a1Soy Maya!  \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya! \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1s? \u00a1S\u00ed, ya voy, ya voy, se\u00f1orita Casandra! \u00a1Estar\u00e9 con usted enseguida! \u00a1Es muy duro el trabajo de recoger miel! \u00a1Ay, ay, ay! \u00a1No! \u00a1Todos en la misma flor! \u00a1No! \u00a1Ay, ay, ay! \u00a1No! \u00a1No! \u00a1No! \u00a1Ay, ay, ay! \u00a1Ay, ay, ay!  \u00a1Oh, este debe ser un capullo! \u00a1Eh, eh, eh! \u00a1Este es mi capullo! \u00a1Sal de aqu\u00ed, sal! Machacando la cabeza de la buena gente con un cacharro de miel. \u00a1Ay, ha sido sin querer! \u00a1Hola! \u00bfHay alguien ah\u00ed dentro? \u00a1Cuidado que voy con mi jarra! De verdad, recolectar miel no es un juego. Una vez no hace da\u00f1o. No deber\u00edamos probar... \u00a1Mmm, fresco!  \u00a1Est\u00e1 tan rica! Si tu jarra est\u00e1 llena, no importa probar un poco. \u00a1Sale un poquito! Esta flor huele especialmente bien. \u00a1Vamos a ver!  \u00a1Mira la jarra! Nadie me dijo que esta pesaba tanto. \u00a1Ay, Dios m\u00edo, lo que pesa! Tendr\u00e9 que descansar un poco. \u00a1Ay, mi jarra de miel! \u00a1La ramita se movi\u00f3 de repente! Soy una oruba y no una ramita. Eres un bicho horroroso. Bueno, es que...  \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 la peque\u00f1a Maya se ha cansado tan pronto? \u00bfQui\u00e9n se est\u00e1 riendo de m\u00ed? \u00bfAlguien dijo mi nombre? Soy yo. Me he tomado la libertad de re\u00edrme de mi peque\u00f1a amiga. No tengas miedo. Soy Flip, el saltamontes y tu buen amigo. Te conozco muy bien, Maya. \u00bfConocerme t\u00fa? No.  \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1s? Aqu\u00ed arriba, en la hoja. \u00bfNo podr\u00edas estarte quieto mientras me hablan? Y ahora dime, \u00bfde qu\u00e9 me conocen? Te conozco desde el d\u00eda en que saliste del panal. \u00bfQu\u00e9? \u00bfDesde que nac\u00ed? \u00a1S\u00ed! Y supongo que para ti es normal saltar como un loco cuando hablas con alguien. Bueno, es una costumbre, por eso soy un saltamontes.  Me paso la vida saltando y comiendo y me divierto observando a los dem\u00e1s Y me lo paso en grande Pues eso no est\u00e1 bien No te enfades, prometo ayudarte cuando tengas dificultades Y estoy seguro de que las tendr\u00e1s siendo como eres tan curiosa y tan impertinente \u00a1Hasta la vista! \u00a1Espera un momento!  \u00a1Qu\u00e9 b\u00e1rbaro c\u00f3mo salta! \u00a1Qu\u00e9 conflicto el m\u00edo! Deber\u00edan hacer las jarras de miel con una tapadera para que no se salga.  Bueno, bueno. Hoy hab\u00e9is aprendido a recoger la miel. \u00bfLo hab\u00e9is pasado bien? \u00a1S\u00ed! Pero no sirve de nada recoger tanta como lo hizo Maya, porque la jarra se vuelve tan pesada que es muy dif\u00edcil llevarla. No se puede aprender todo en un d\u00eda. Casandra deber\u00eda saber muy bien eso. No se gan\u00f3 Zamora en una hora. Las cosas necesitan su tiempo. Y no olvid\u00e9is que cuando vol\u00e9is hay que...  Tener mucho cuidado con la ara\u00f1a y su tela. La ara\u00f1a es nuestro peor enemigo. \u00bfA d\u00f3nde ha ido Maya otra vez? En cuanto la pierdo de vista, se va. \u00bfEst\u00e1 volando por ah\u00ed? Tiene muchos p\u00e1jaros en la cabeza. Mira c\u00f3mo se mueve todo nada m\u00e1s tocarlo. \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya, ven aqu\u00ed inmediatamente! Esta chica est\u00e1... \u00a1Estoy aqu\u00ed, se\u00f1orita! \u00a1C\u00f3jame!  Mira, Maya. \u00a1Vuelo directamente hacia la tela ara\u00f1a! \u00a1Maya, Maya, Maya! Es que hace un momento que deb\u00e9is tener cuidado con la tela de ara\u00f1a. Pero claro, como siempre, t\u00fa te hab\u00edas ido a otro sitio. \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya, qu\u00e9date aqu\u00ed! \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1s? \u00a1Aqu\u00ed estoy! \u00a1Aqu\u00ed! \u00a1D\u00e9jate hacer tonter\u00edas! \u00bfMe oyes? \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya! \u00a1No! \u00a1D\u00e9jame! \u00a1D\u00e9jame! \u00a1Maya!  \u00a1Ah! \u00a1Esta vez s\u00ed que has estado cerca! \u00bfQu\u00e9? \u00a1Ah! \u00a1Eres t\u00fa, Flip! \u00bfTe das cuenta del peligro que has corrido?  \u00a1No! \u00a1Qu\u00e9 peligro! Es que no has visto la telara\u00f1a. \u00bfY qu\u00e9 es eso, Flip? Ya no soy tu maestro. Preg\u00fantaselo a la se\u00f1orita Casandra. \u00bfQu\u00e9 es lo que debo preguntar a la se\u00f1orita Casandra? \u00a1Qu\u00e9 t\u00edo malgracias! \u00a1Vaya!  Bueno, aqu\u00ed estamos de nuevo. Despacio, no tir\u00e9is la miel. Con cuidado, vamos. Hab\u00eda recogido tanta miel y ya no me queda nada.  No voy a dejar que sonr\u00edan de m\u00ed. Llenar\u00e9 mi jarra otra vez. No tengo ganas. \u00a1Hurra!  \u00a1Uy! \u00a1Una salta mortal! \u00a1Una salta mortal! \u00a1Uy! \u00bfQu\u00e9 era eso?  \u00a1Ay, Dios m\u00edo! \u00bfQu\u00e9 me ha pasado ahora? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no puedo volar as\u00ed de repente? \u00a1Se\u00f1orita! \u00a1Se\u00f1orita! \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1? \u00a1Se\u00f1orita Casandra! \u00a1Se\u00f1orita Casandra! \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1?  \u00a1Se\u00f1orita! \u00a1Se\u00f1orita Cassandra!

        "translated": "In a multi-colored country, a bee was born under the sun, and was famous in the place, for being of its kindness. Grandma's bee, Grandma's bee, This beautiful sweet bee Maya Goes good without ceasing In her world without evil There is no problem that Maya can't solve The mischievous and sweet bee Maya Maya I love you Maya Maya Maya, Maya, Maya, come and tell us about yourself. Stop! The password! Come! A little grove of birch, hazel, saffron rose. Go ahead. A few sips of plant juice. In the morning it's a delicious treat. Good morning, ladies. Working so early? No, the airways are very... busy this morning I see. Oh, right! A queen bee. That's why there's so much fuss. The bees are having a party. Oh! Come on! Come on! Come on! Quick! Quick! The honeycombs are melting! Come on! Everybody to the honeycombs! The honey is coming out! Come on! Come on! Come on! Quick! What's the matter? Why are they shouting so much? Hey, Willy! Wait! What are you doing here, Willy? Just like the others, flapping my wings. What nonsense! What for? Gosh, I'll pretend I didn't hear that. I had despaired. There were too many bees in the hive, too much heat, and they had to swarm. Now what we have to do is create a draft. When it's too hot, the wax melts in the honeycombs and the eggs and larvae die, understand? Hey, Maya! Where are you going? Stay here, we're not going to learn to fly yet. I know that, but when I move my wings I can't help it. I'm sorry. Good! Good! Aha! Aha! Well, they've done it again. I think they're a bit nuts. Well, it's all the same to me. In my little hole in the ground it's nice and warm, but they have to build a hive with thousands and thousands of rooms. Oh no! Silence on the back bench! Silence on the back bench! always lurking in the dark. That's why a bee must never leave the hive at night, don't forget that. Miss, may I ask a question? Yes, what is it, Maya? When can we finally get out of here and fly away? The promised one has been here for over a week now. Exactly. An old proverb says, experience is the mother of science. Don't be so impertinent. When the time comes, you'll fly away. And when will that time come, eh? And besides, what do you mean by when the time comes? I mean, it will be this very evening. Maya! Maya! Maya's gonna fly, Maya's gonna fly. Now Maya's gonna fly. Now Maya's gonna fly, she's gonna fly. Maya! I'm sorry. Can't you watch where you're going? I'm just so nervous. Why am I going to be allowed to fly for the first time? It's so great. And you know what? I'm gonna fly straight into the sun. Maya's gonna fly! Maya! I remember my first flight very well. My God, it's been so long now. We don't want to fool you. Now we're going to fly, fly, fly. Stop, stop! It's me. Tell me, are you Willy, eh? No, I'm Maya. Oh, I thought you were Willy. Go on, go on, go on. What's the matter with Willy? Nothing, nothing, just go on, little one. Okay, okay. Ah! Ah! Well, you're here? I thought you were looking forward to flying. And I am. But first I had to tell everyone that I'm going to fly for the first time today. I've brushed my wings! Look, look how shiny they are! Come on, kids, let's get started. Great! Maybe it's a little low, don't you think? Come on, Maya, you try it. All right. Help, help, help! Oops, I'm falling! That always happens when you try to fly too high. How strange! Someone's missing here. Isn't Willy here? No? How funny! Why didn't he come to class with us? Do you know why he is not here, Miss? He may be sick. Ah. Maya! Maya! Go with the others and they will not leave. Flying. They're gone now, Willy. What? Then why did you come back? Why? Because I didn't feel like flying. That's not true. Don't lie to me. You were crazy about flying. Much more than us. It's my fault, Pia. Because of me you stayed behind. Because I can't fly because of that. It's not true. Didn't you stay here for me? And what does it matter why I stayed? Don't you want me to read you a story? You knew that, didn't you? Did you know that I was afraid to fly? Because I don't know how to, and that's why you've come back. What idea have you got into your head? It's not that I imagine that I don't know how to fly, it's that I don't know. The old bee proverb is right. A friend is the most precious treasure. It seems that the little bees are making their first outing today. I don't see Maya with them. Maybe they've locked her up again. What? I'm curious to know. I'll ask Miss Cassandra. This will make him look twice, ma'am. We grasshoppers are clever fellows. How rude! Doing somersaults when you're in the mood! Talking to a lady. Oh, you don't understand me, my dear lady! I have hot blood and a lot of temper, a lot of temper, \u00f1a, \u00f1a, \u00f1a, \u00f1a. Oh, our little Maya! She's probably done some of her thing already. She's charming, but very naughty, very naughty, \u00f1a, \u00f1a, \u00f1a, \u00f1a. Well, well! Well! Oops! Ah! And now, a little chicken soup. No, no, no! This will give you strength to fly. No, I can eat more noise, burst. Change more! Come on, you can still have another bowl of soup. Come on, open your mouth. Oh, but I can't eat anything else. I'm beginning to feel sick and very heavy. What's the matter, Willy? Are you not feeling well? Ouch, my belly is so full it's going to burst. Why is your belly so full? Ouch, Maya thought I didn't have enough balls to fly and I had to eat all that. Ouch. Ouch, ouch. Ouch, ouch. Maya. Ouch. Ouch. There comes my little friend! Congratulations on your first flight, Maya! She's so worried she can't even hear me. It smells so good in here! It must be the flowers. Aren't they wonderful? Good morning, flowers! I'm Maya! Maya! Maya! Where are you? Yes, I'm coming, I'm coming, Miss Cassandra! I'll be with you in a moment! It's very hard work collecting honey! Ouch, ouch, ouch! No! All in the same flower! No! Ouch, ouch, ouch! No! No! No! Ouch, ouch, ouch! Ouch, ouch, ouch! Oh, this must be a cocoon! Hey, hey, hey! This is my cocoon! Get out of here, get out! Crushing good people's heads with a honey pot. Oops, that was by accident! Hello! Is anyone in there? Watch out, I'm coming with my jar! Seriously, collecting honey is no game. Once never hurts. We shouldn't try... Mmm, fresh! It's so delicious! If your jar is full, it's okay to try a little. Just a little comes out! This flower smells especially good. Let's see! Look at the jar! Nobody told me it was so heavy. Oh, my God, it's so heavy! I'll have to rest for a while. Oh, my honey jar! The twig suddenly moved! I'm a honeybee and not a twig. You're a horrible bug. Well, it's just that... Why did little Maya get tired so soon? Who is laughing at me? Did someone say my name? It's me. I've taken the liberty of laughing at my little friend. Don't be afraid. I'm Flip, the grasshopper and your good friend. I know you very well, Maya. Do you know me? No. Where are you? Up here on the leaf. Couldn't you just keep still while they talk to me? Now tell me, how do they know me? I've known you since the day you came out of the hive. What? Since I was born? Yes! And I suppose it's normal for you to jump like crazy when you talk to someone. Well, it's a habit, that's why I'm a grasshopper.          Oops! A somersault! A somersault! Oops! What was that? Oh my God! What happened to me now? Why can't I fly away all of a sudden? Miss! Miss! Where are you? Miss Cassandra! Miss Cassandra! Where are you? Miss! Miss Cassandra! I can't fly anymore, my God. What am I going to do? And what will happen when it gets dark? Little Maya, what's that face? Flip, it's you! You've got your wings wet, eh? Get on my back, they'll dry off while we jump. What if I fall? Ah! Hold on tight, I'm gonna use my longest jumps. One, two, three, noo, noo, noo, noo. Keep going, this is fantastic! Great! It makes me look so short! The wind! Jump! You want me to jump higher, Maya! No, no, no! Stop, stop, stop! Are you okay now? Are your wings gone, Maya? Yeah, yeah! Everything's back to the way it was, Flip! Yeah, yeah! to your teacher when she asks you why you've been out there for so long. I'm afraid I can't help you with that, you'll have to figure it out on your own. See you later! Little Maya never tires of flying. She would like to fly high, very high, until she reaches the sun. In the next episode, Maya the bee... No, no, no, I'm not going to tell you anything. But I assure you that it will be a fun and exciting story. Until then, my friends. \u00a9 BF-WATCH TV 2021 \u00a9 BF-WATCH TV 2021"

Y a la peque\u00f1a abeja le llamaron ma\u00f1ana, esta bella dulce.  \u00a1Vaya abuela sin cesar! \u00a1En su mundo sin maldad! \u00a1No hay problema que no solucione! \u00a1Vaya! \u00a1La traviesa y dulce abeja! \u00a1Vaya! \u00a1Vaya yo te quiero! \u00a1Vaya! \u00a1Vaya!  Maya, Maya, ven ya El nacimiento de Maya  \u00bfEh? \u00a1Oh, buenos d\u00edas, buenos d\u00edas a todo el mundo! Como ver\u00e9is, soy un saltamontes y me llamo Flea. Y quiero ser vuestro amigo porque durante muchos d\u00edas nos vamos a estar viendo. Bueno, estoy seguro de que nos llevaremos bien. Bueno, en este momento no s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 contaros porque \u00faltimamente parece que no pasa nada por aqu\u00ed. Pod\u00e9is creerme, la vida de un saltamontes es a veces bastante aburrida, saltando siempre de un lado para otro y comiendo hierba. Se hace mon\u00f3tona, mon\u00f3tona. Voy a echar un vistazo.  \u00a1Oh, mirad! \u00a1Una mariposa! Y all\u00e1 lejos veo un enjambre de abejas Habr\u00e1n estado recogiendo miel Hay que reconocer que las abejas son muy trabajadoras Creo que vuelven a su colmena \u00a1Buenos d\u00edas, se\u00f1oras! \u00a1Buenos d\u00edas! \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no dejan caer alguna gotita de miel? Una gotita, una gotita Bueno, aunque tenga mucho que hacer por el d\u00eda  Podr\u00edan por lo menos dar los buenos d\u00edas. Qu\u00e9 comportamiento tan raro. No es habitual en ellas, \u00bfno? No es habitual en absoluto. \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1 mi sombrero? Hace tanto viento que mi sombrero se vuela. Pero bueno, ya est\u00e1n aqu\u00ed otra vez. Debe ocurrir algo extraordinario. \u00a1Oigan, oigan! \u00bfQu\u00e9 les pasa? \u00a1Ay, qu\u00e9 raro! Vuelan de ac\u00e1 para all\u00e1, de all\u00e1 para ac\u00e1, de ac\u00e1 para all\u00e1. Como locas. Hola, peque\u00f1o, \u00bfdando un paseo?  No debe extra\u00f1aros que no me conteste, es que no sabe hablar a\u00fan Es como los ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os, abre su boquita tan solo para que le den de comer Tengo una idea, ya que en la colmena debe ocurrir algo especial \u00bfQu\u00e9 os parece si vamos all\u00e1 para enterarnos, eh? En aquel castillo, al lado del gran abeto, est\u00e1 la colmena \u00a1Oye! \u00a1Oye! \u00a1Oye!  \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no me dej\u00e1is entrar? \u00bfNo sab\u00e9is qui\u00e9n soy? La contrase\u00f1a. Sin contrase\u00f1a no hay paso. Pero bueno, \u00bfes que no me reconoces? Soy Casandra, la que te ha ense\u00f1ado tu  Yo he sido tu maestra. \u00bfCon Casandra? Hoy es un gran d\u00eda. Nacer\u00e1n nuevos hermanos y hermanas. Pero si no me dej\u00e1is pasar, se asfixiar\u00e1n. Y vosotros aqu\u00ed haci\u00e9ndome perder el tiempo. Por favor, tranquil\u00edcese, se\u00f1orita Casandra. La comprendemos, pero debe comprendernos tambi\u00e9n a nosotros. Tenemos \u00f3rdenes que cumplir. Yo tambi\u00e9n tengo que obedecer \u00f3rdenes, pero hay que saber distinguir cuando una orden es una orden y cuando debe dejar de serlo, si el caso es urgente. Nosotros no pod\u00edamos saber que tuviera tanta importancia. Bueno, \u00bfme dej\u00e1is pasar o no? Pero claro, natural.  Normalmente, pase usted. Bien, ya estoy aqu\u00ed. Espero no llegar tarde. No, no, va a empezar en cualquier momento. Ya empieza, venga, deprisa.  Colocaros todas en fila \u00a1Oh, mira! \u00a1R\u00e1pido, daros tiempo! \u00a1Oh, mira!  \u00bfQu\u00e9 es esto? Es que no hay nadie. Y esto no se abre. Vaya, pues s\u00ed que empiezo bien esto. \u00bfEscuchas? Tiene que ser Maya. Todo lo tiene que hacer una misma.  \u00bfNo hay nadie? Pues claro que hay alguien. Sal de una vez, Maya. Vamos, date prisa. Eres la \u00fanica que falta. \u00bfMaya? \u00bfQui\u00e9n es Maya? Es que Maya soy yo. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 me ha puesto usted ese nombre? D\u00edgame. Pues no hay ninguna raz\u00f3n especial. Simplemente porque cada una ten\u00e9is que tener un nombre. \u00a1Aj\u00e1! \u00bfY usted tambi\u00e9n tiene un nombre? S\u00ed, yo soy la se\u00f1orita Casandra y hasta que seas mayor me ocupar\u00e9 de ti.  Me alegro de haber salido, estaba muy inc\u00f3moda T\u00fa has tenido la culpa, los dem\u00e1s han salido ya hace rato \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no saliste antes, peque\u00f1a? Es que estaba so\u00f1ando una cosa muy bonita \u00bfQu\u00e9 dices? \u00bfUna abeja so\u00f1ando? Hay que ver \u00bfQuiere que se lo cuente? Era una cosa muy divertida Uy, \u00bfc\u00f3mo funciona esto? Tengo que saltar o viene a buscarme Espera, ir\u00e9 a buscarte, Maya Me va a coger en brazos Ven, peque\u00f1a, ven, se acabaron los sue\u00f1os No  Ven, ahora te espera la realidad. Tendr\u00e1s que aprender muchas cosas. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 vuelan para aqu\u00ed? Est\u00e1n empezando a reunirse para el enjambre. \u00bfQue se van a reunir un enjambre? \u00bfQu\u00e9 es eso? No, he dicho que se re\u00fanen para el enjambre. No lo comprendo. Es muy pronto para que t\u00fa lo comprendas. Primero tendr\u00e1s que aprender cosas m\u00e1s sencillas. Ah, s\u00ed. \u00bfY para qu\u00e9 lo hacen, eh? Porque las abejas hacemos esto desde que empezamos a existir. \u00bfY por qu\u00e9 las abejas hacemos esto?  \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no me lo explicas, pero de manera que yo lo comprenda? \u00bfY c\u00f3mo voy a comprender las cosas si nadie me las explica? Pero, peque\u00f1a, una cosa tras otra, no todas al mismo tiempo. Ven, vamos con los dem\u00e1s. Bueno, vale. \u00bfY por qu\u00e9 una cosa tras otra? Porque tu cabecita es demasiado peque\u00f1a para comprenderlas todas. Espere, se\u00f1orita. Ya s\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 no me lo dice, porque usted tampoco lo sabe. Porque... Porque...  r\u00ede usted, yo no lo encuentro tan gracioso. \u00a1Ay, qu\u00e9 jaleo! \u00a1Ay, qu\u00e9 jaleo! \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa all\u00ed? \u00a1Ah! Parece que van a enjambrar. Por eso hay tanta excitaci\u00f3n. En realidad no pasa nada especial. En el d\u00eda de los nacimientos hay demasiadas abejas en la colmena y la mitad tiene que emigrar para buscarse una colmena nueva. Esto ya lo he visto.  He visto muchas veces, pero como no hay nada m\u00e1s interesante, seguir\u00e9 viendo como las abejas van y vienen. \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya, no vayas por all\u00ed! \u00bfNo? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no? Porque eso ya lo ver\u00e1s m\u00e1s adelante. Y haz el favor de no preguntar tanto, me vas a volver loca con tanto por qu\u00e9. Por all\u00ed enfrente est\u00e1 muy claro que hay all\u00ed. \u00a1Maya! \u00a1Maya, qu\u00e9date aqu\u00ed! Por aqu\u00ed se sale al mundo exterior, \u00bfverdad? Pero yo a\u00fan no puedo salir. Si lo sabes, vuelve ahora mismo. Buenos d\u00edas, se\u00f1orita.  Se\u00f1orita. Pero es que soy tan feo que le doy miedo, se\u00f1orita. Se\u00f1orita Casandra, \u00bfd\u00f3nde est\u00e1? \u00bfQu\u00e9? \u00bfPor fin miraste hacia afuera? \u00bfQui\u00e9n era ese? Era Flip, el saltamonte. Es un tipo bastante vago. Vive completamente solo, algo incomprensible para las abejas. Se\u00f1orita Casandra, ahora voy por all\u00ed. \u00a1Maya! Adi\u00f3s, se\u00f1orita. \u00a1Qu\u00e9 chiquilla est\u00e1! Esc\u00fachame bien, Maya. No puedo perder todo mi tiempo contigo. Espero que lo puedas comprender. S\u00ed, la compr\u00e9.  \u00bfPero qu\u00e9 hacen all\u00ed? Construyen panales nuevos. Y dentro de los panales colocan los huevos. \u00bfY por qu\u00e9 lo hacen? En los panales los huevos est\u00e1n protegidos. Y al cabo de algunas semanas nacen peque\u00f1as abejas como t\u00fa. \u00bfYo he sido un huevecito como ese? Naturalmente. \u00bfVes c\u00f3mo colocan un huevo en cada uno?  cada celda. \u00bfLo ves? Ahora viene otra abeja y cierra la entrada con cera. Esas son las abejas obreras que trabajan solamente en la colmena. Ellas construyen los panales y cuidan de los huevos. Tienen que trabajar mucho porque nuestra reina pone muchos huevos diariamente. Seguramente no te puedes imaginar que t\u00fa alg\u00fan d\u00eda tambi\u00e9n fuiste un huevo, \u00bfverdad? \u00a1Oh, Maya! \u00bfD\u00f3nde se ha metido esa peque\u00f1a?  \u00a1Ay, c\u00f3mo pesa! \u00a1Lo he conseguido! \u00a1Est\u00e1 ah\u00ed arriba! Ve, se\u00f1orita Casandra, ya lo s\u00e9 hacer. Espera un momento, solo un huevo en cada celda. \u00bfY por qu\u00e9? Cuando salgan, si son dos, podr\u00e1n entretenerse.  De la otra manera es demasiado aburrido. Pero Maya, nosotras no venimos a este mundo para entretenernos, sino para trabajar. Me sorprendes, hija m\u00eda. Yo nunca tuve pensamientos tan extra\u00f1os como t\u00fa. Sin embargo, creo que dos huevos en una celda es mejor. Pero la experiencia de cientos de a\u00f1os nos ha ense\u00f1ado que es mejor as\u00ed. \u00bfY por qu\u00e9 es mejor as\u00ed? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no se hacen celdas grandes para muchos huevos? Ven conmigo, s\u00edgueme.  \u00a1Qu\u00e9 bien huele aqu\u00ed! \u00bfDe d\u00f3nde viene? Me est\u00e1 entrando de repente mucha hambre. Ya lo s\u00e9, es por la miel que est\u00e1s oliendo.  Ay, pero porque no se mueve, tiene que moverse. D\u00e9jalo, pesa demasiado para ti. Todo esto est\u00e1 lleno de miel. S\u00ed, aqu\u00ed se guarda la miel para el invierno.  Vaya, ven aqu\u00ed ahora mismo, una abeja no debe ser golosa Se\u00f1orita, Casandra est\u00e1 riqu\u00edsima Oh, qu\u00e9 ni\u00f1a tan terrible eres Oh, qu\u00e9 ni\u00f1a tan terrible eres  Hay que ver c\u00f3mo te has puesto. Est\u00e1 muy rica, pero muy pegajosa. \u00a1Ay, no puedo m\u00e1s verme! Ma\u00f1ana, o a lo sumo pasado ma\u00f1ana, vais a salir por primera vez a ver el cielo azul. Se\u00f1orita Casandra, \u00bfpuede explicarme qu\u00e9 es un cielo azul? Espera a que pueda salir de la colmena, entonces te lo explicar\u00e9 todo. Pero no te creas que fuera todo...  Todo es diversi\u00f3n. Ninguna peque\u00f1a abeja debe volar sola afuera. \u00bfMe entiendes? Afuera os esperan muchos peligros y deb\u00e9is aprender cu\u00e1les son para evitarlos. S\u00ed, s\u00ed, se\u00f1orita Cassandra. Yo ya lo s\u00e9 porque he suspendido dos veces, s\u00ed. Bueno, Willy, entonces t\u00fa sabr\u00e1s que este es un avisp\u00f3n nuestro peor enemigo. Es diez veces m\u00e1s grande que nosotras. Cuidaros mucho de no encontraros con el ni\u00f1o. No, no os quer\u00eda asustar. Volved a vuestro sitio r\u00e1pido. Aqu\u00ed dentro no hay avispones.  Nuestras viejas abejas tienen mucho cuidado. No teng\u00e1is miedo. En esta l\u00e1mina veis a una rana. No vol\u00e9is nunca demasiado cerca del agua. Si su larga y pegabosa lengua os atrapa alguna vez, no hay forma de escapar. Bueno, calma, calma. Aqu\u00ed nunca podr\u00eda entrar una rana. Se\u00f1orita, \u00bfsignifica eso que no debemos acercarnos nunca a los sitios donde hay ranas? As\u00ed es, Willy. No lo olvide. \u00bfT\u00fa te llamas Willy? S\u00ed, yo soy Willy. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 tienes esa voz tan rara? Es la poes\u00eda.  \u00a1Pubertad! \u00a1Ya tengo dos a\u00f1os! Bueno, yo soy maya. \u00bfA lo mejor has o\u00eddo hablar de m\u00ed? S\u00ed, s\u00ed, pero solo cosas malas. Vuelves loca a la se\u00f1orita con tus preguntas y cosas as\u00ed. Como todo en esta vida, el mundo tiene dos caras. Una bonita y otra menos bonita. Si, por ejemplo, llueve o hay tormenta, no es nada bonito. En ese caso, hay que volver inmediatamente a la colmena o buscar refugio debajo de las hojas. Por ejemplo, hoy que llueve y hay mucho viento, \u00bfqu\u00e9 debe hacer una peque\u00f1a abeja obediente, eh? \u00bfLo sabes t\u00fa, Willy? S\u00ed, nos quedamos en la colmena.  \u00bfY qu\u00e9 le ocurrir\u00eda a una abeja que sale con este tiempo? Pero, peque\u00f1a, si te acabo de explicar. \u00bfPero qu\u00e9 l\u00edo es este? Quedaros en vuestros sitios enseguida vuelvo, \u00bfvale? \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa? Creo que con esta tormenta se deben de cerrar todas las portezuelas. \u00bfA d\u00f3nde vas? Voy a ver qu\u00e9 hay fuera. Pero, Maya, qu\u00e9date. \u00a1Maya!  No debe salir. Ven aqu\u00ed. \u00a1Vamos de ah\u00ed! \u00a1S\u00ed, que atamos! \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 os pon\u00e9is en el palo? Debe estar en el pupito. \u00a1Est\u00e1 quieto!  Pero bueno, \u00bfde d\u00f3nde sale este florero? \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa aqu\u00ed? \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa aqu\u00ed? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 lloras, vamos? \u00a1Ay, qu\u00e9 ansia! Los dem\u00e1s los pod\u00e9is callar. Willy, t\u00fa eres el mayor aqu\u00ed. Pon un poco de orden. Ya lo hab\u00e9is o\u00eddo. Debo poner orden en todo esto. \u00a1Callaos ya!  \u00a1Uy! \u00a1Un rev\u00e9s pollo! \u00a1Un rev\u00e9s pollo! Pero no es verdad. Es el que hemos visto antes. Ya nos acord\u00e1is, \u00bfeh? Como soy el profesor, ahora os voy a ense\u00f1ar otra cosa. Ahora es una ara\u00f1a. La ara\u00f1a ara\u00f1a. Por eso  se llama ara\u00f1a, \u00bfest\u00e1 claro? \u00a1S\u00ed!

Y dicen que el cielo es azul. \u00bfQu\u00e9 tiene de bonito todo esto? Yo creo que es un tulipano.  \u00a1Pero Willy! \u00a1Ah, se\u00f1orita Casandra! \u00bfQu\u00e9 haces aqu\u00ed? \u00bfY vosotros no os he dicho que os qued\u00e9is en vuestros sitios? He vigilado para que no hagan tonter\u00edas. Muy bien, Willy, ahora si\u00e9ntate. Bien, Maya, \u00bfquieres decirme lo que es esto? \u00bfEh? \u00a1Oh, Maya, \u00bfd\u00f3nde est\u00e1? \u00bfSabe alguien d\u00f3nde est\u00e1? \u00bfAlguien la ha visto salir?

No me da m\u00e1s que disgustos, nada m\u00e1s que disgustos. Mira, ya parece otra cosa. Si el mundo estuviera siempre tan lleno de colores y el cielo tan azul... \u00a1Ah\u00ed va! \u00a1Ah\u00ed est\u00e1 el tipo divertido de antes! Soy un saltamontes que le gusta el sol.  Y saltar sin parar, me divierto mucho en cualquier lugar, viendo a todos trabajar.  La abeja maya tengo que cuidar Si se va del panal Pero es tan traviesa que me va a irritar Siempre quiere ir a jugar  De un gran salto voy lejos a buscar a mi buena maya que vuelve sin valor. Todos me conocen y me llaman Flip, yo soy Flip, el gran Flip, cuento las historias que se ven aqu\u00ed.  en mi peque\u00f1o pa\u00eds. Soy un saltamontes que le gusta el sol, yo soy Flip.

Soy la se\u00f1orita Cassandra. \u00bfPero qu\u00e9 dice? \u00bfA qu\u00e9 viene tanto grito? Si no contestas ahora mismo. Si por casualidad busca ese energ\u00fameno malcriado que casi nos tira al pasar, lo encontrar\u00e1 por all\u00ed. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 dice tantas tonter\u00edas? \u00a1Maya!

        "translated": "In a multi-colored country, a bee was born under the sun, and was famous in the place, for her blessing and her kindness. And the little bee was called tomorrow, this beautiful sweet one. Oh, that endless grandmother! In her world without evil! There is no problem she doesn't solve! Oh! The naughty and sweet bee! Oh! Oh, I love you! Oh! Oh! Maya, Maya, come now The birth of Maya Huh? Oh, good morning, good morning to everyone! As you can see, I'm a grasshopper and my name is Flea. And I want to be your friend because we're going to be seeing each other for many days. Well, I'm sure we'll get along just fine. Well, I don't know what to tell you right now because lately it seems like nothing is happening around here. You can believe me, the life of a grasshopper is sometimes quite boring, always jumping around and eating grass. It gets monotonous, monotonous. I'm going to take a look. Oh, look! A butterfly! And yonder I see a swarm of bees They must have been collecting honey You must admit that bees are very hard-working I think they're going back to their hive Good morning, ladies! Good morning! Why don't you drop a few drops of honey? A drop, a drop Well, even though I have a lot to do today They could at least say good morning. What strange behaviour. It's not like them, isn't it? It's not like them at all. Where's my hat? It's so windy that my hat is blowing off. But here they are again. Something extraordinary must be happening. Hey, hey! What's the matter with them? Oh, how strange! They're flying around, back and forth, back and forth, like crazy. Hello, little one, taking a walk? You shouldn't be surprised that he doesn't answer me, it's just that he doesn't know how to talk yet. He's like a little child, he only opens his little mouth so that they can feed him. I have an idea, since something special must be going on in the hive. How about we go there and find out, eh? In that castle, next to the big fir tree, is the hive. Hey! Hey! Hey! What's wrong? Why won't you let me in? Don't you know who I am? The password. Without a password, there's no way through. But anyway, don't you recognize me? I'm Cassandra, the one who showed you your name. I have been your teacher. With Cassandra? Today is a great day. New brothers and sisters will be born. But if you don't let me in, they will suffocate. And here you are, wasting my time. Please calm down, Miss Cassandra. We understand you, but you must understand us too. We have orders to follow. I have to follow orders too, but you have to know when an order is an order and when it should stop being one, if the case is urgent. We couldn't know that it was so important. Well, will you let me in or not? But of course, of course. Normally, come in. Well, I'm here now. I hope I'm not late. No, no, it's going to start any minute. It's starting now, come on, hurry up. Get in line all together Oh, look! Quick, give it time! Oh, look! What is this? There's no one here. And this won't open. Wow, I'm off to a good start here. Do you hear? It has to be Maya. She has to do everything herself. Nobody's there? Of course there is. Come on, Maya. Come on, hurry up. You're the only one missing. Maya? Who's Maya? Maya is me. Why did you give me that name? Tell me. There's no special reason. Just because each of you has to have a name. Aha! And you have a name too? Yes, I'm Miss Cassandra and I'll take care of you until you're older. I'm glad I got out, I was so uncomfortable It's your fault, the others left a while ago Why didn't you get out sooner, little one? I was dreaming a very nice thing What are you saying? A bee dreaming? Oh, do you want me to tell you? It was a very funny thing Oops, how does this work? I have to jump or he'll come for me Wait, I'll come for you, Maya He's going to pick me up Come, little one, come, no more dreams No Come, now reality awaits you. You will have to learn many things. Why do they fly here? They are beginning to gather for the swarm. Are they going to gather for a swarm? What is that? No, I said they gather for the swarm. I don't understand. It's too early for you to understand. You will have to learn simpler things first. Oh, yes. And what do they do it for, eh? Because bees have been doing this since we began to exist. And why do bees do this? Why don't you explain it to me, but in a way that I understand? And how am I supposed to understand things if nobody explains them to me? But, little one, one thing after another, not all at once. Come, let's go with the others. Well, okay. And why one thing after another? Because your little head is too small to understand them all. Wait, little lady. I know why you don't tell me, because you don't know either. Because... Because... You laugh, I don't find it so funny. Oh, what a mess! Oh, what a mess! What's going on there? Ah! It looks like they're going to swarm. That's why there's so much excitement. Nothing special is really happening. On the day of the births there are too many bees in the hive and half of them have to migrate to find a new hive. I've seen that before. I've seen it many times, but since there's nothing more interesting, I'll just keep watching the bees come and go. Maya! Maya, don't go over there! No? Why not? Because you'll see that later. And please don't ask so many questions, you'll drive me crazy with all your whys. It's very clear what's there over there. Maya! Maya, stay here! This is where you get out to the outside world, right? But I can't get out yet. If you know, come back right now. Good morning, young lady. Miss. But I'm so ugly that I scare you, Miss. Miss Cassandra, where are you? What? Did you finally look outside? Who was that? It was Flip, the grasshopper. He's quite a lazy fellow. He lives all alone, which is incomprehensible to the bees. Miss Cassandra, I'll be right over there. Maya! Goodbye, Miss. You're such a little girl! Listen to me carefully, Maya. I can't waste all my time with you. I hope you can understand. Yes, I bought her. But what do they do there? They build new honeycombs. And inside the honeycombs they lay their eggs. And why do they do that? In the honeycombs the eggs are protected. And after a few weeks little bees like you are born. Was I an egg like that? Of course. Do you see how they lay an egg in each one? each cell. Do you see? Now another bee comes and seals the entrance with wax. These are the worker bees that work only in the hive. They build the honeycombs and take care of the eggs. They have to work hard because our queen lays many eggs every day. You probably can't imagine that you were once an egg too, right? Oh, Maya! Where has that little one gone? Oh, how heavy it is! I've got it! It's up there! Go on, Miss Cassandra, I know how to do it. Wait a minute, only one egg in each cell. And why? When they come out, if there are two of them, they can amuse themselves. It is too boring otherwise. But Maya, we are not brought into this world for entertainment, but for work. You surprise me, my daughter. I have never had such strange thoughts as you. However, I believe that two eggs in one cell is better. But the experience of hundreds of years has taught us that it is better this way. And why is it better this way? Why are not large cells made for many eggs? Come with me, follow me. It smells so good in here! Where is it coming from? I'm suddenly feeling very hungry. I know, it's because of the honey you're smelling. Oh, but because it doesn't move, it has to move. Leave it alone, it's too heavy for you. This is all full of honey. Yes, honey is stored here for the winter. Come here right now, a bee must not be greedy Miss, Cassandra is delicious Oh, what a terrible girl you are Oh, what a terrible girl you are You've got such a mess. It's so nice, but so sticky. Oh, I can't stand to look at myself anymore! Tomorrow, or at the latest the day after tomorrow, you're going out to see the blue sky for the first time. Miss Cassandra, can you explain to me what a blue sky is? Wait until I can get out of the hive, then I'll explain everything to you. But don't think that's all... It's all in good fun. No little bee should fly alone outside. Do you understand me? There are many dangers waiting for you outside and you must learn what they are in order to avoid them. Yes, yes, Miss Cassandra. I know that because I have failed twice, yes. Well, Willy, then you know that this is a hornet, our worst enemy. It is ten times bigger than us. Be very careful not to meet the boy. No, I didn't want to scare you. Go back to your place quickly. There are no hornets in here. Our old bees are very careful. Don't be afraid. In this picture you see a frog. Never fly too close to water. If its long, sticky tongue ever catches you, there's no way out. Now, calm down, calm down. A frog could never get in here. Miss, does that mean we must never go near places where there are frogs? Yes, Willy. Don't forget it. Is your name Willy? Yes, I am Willy. Why do you have such a strange voice? It's poetry. Puberty! I'm two years old now! Well, I'm Maya. Maybe you've heard of me? Yes, yes, but only bad things. You drive the young lady crazy with your questions and such. Like everything in life, the world has two sides. One pretty and one not so pretty. If, for example, it rains or there's a storm, it's not pretty at all. In that case, you have to go back to the hive immediately or find shelter under the leaves. For example, today when it's raining and it's very windy, what should a little obedient bee do, eh? Do you know that, Willy? Yes, we stay in the hive. And what would happen to a bee that goes out in this weather? But, little one, I've just explained it to you. What's all this mess about? Stay where you are, I'll be right back, okay? What's the matter? I think all the doors must be closed in this storm. Where are you going? I'm going to see what's outside. But, Maya, stay. Maya! He mustn't be out. Come here. Let's go from there! Yes, we'll tie him up! Why are you all standing on the pole? He must be in the little seat. He's still! But where did this vase come from? What's going on here? What's going on here? Why are you crying, come on? Oh, how anxious! The rest of you can shut up. Willy, you're the oldest here. Put some order in here. You heard me. I must put order in all this. Shut up now! Oops! A chicken backhand! A chicken backhand! But it's not true. It's the one we saw before. You remember us, right? Since I'm the teacher, I'm going to show you something else now. Now it's a spider. The spider spider. That's why It's called a spider, is that clear? Yes! I saw one in passing, it's called a key and it was playing the violin. Willy, I think you're crazy. No, no, I'm not crazy, she played the violin. This is a tulip, the honey of the tulip. Is it a tulip? You don't even believe it yourself? A master has the right to make mistakes, doesn't he? Music! What a wind it's blowing! No, the world isn't like that! as wonderful as they say. And they say the sky is blue. What's so beautiful about all this? I think it's a tulip. But Willy! Oh, Miss Cassandra! What are you doing here? And didn't I tell you to stay where you were? I've been watching to make sure you don't do anything stupid. All right, Willy, now sit down. Now, Maya, will you tell me what this is? Huh? Oh, Maya, where is she? Does anyone know where she is? Did anyone see her leave? Yes, I did. She left. I know where she is, too. Where has she gone? She wanted to see the storm. Oh! What a naughty little girl! She gives me nothing but trouble, nothing but trouble. Look, she seems different now. If only the world were always so full of colour and the sky so blue... There she goes! There she is, the funny guy from before! I am a grasshopper who likes the sun. And jumping non-stop, I have a lot of fun anywhere, watching everyone work. Maya the bee I have to take care of If she leaves the hive But she is so naughty that she will irritate me She always wants to go and play With a great leap I go far away to find my good Maya who returns without value. Everyone knows me and calls me Flip, I am Flip, the great Flip, I tell the stories that are seen here. in my little country. I'm a grasshopper who likes the sun, I'm Flip. Everyone knows me, They don't know me or call me Flip, the great Flip. The great Flip. I'm Flip the grasshopper. Bravo, bravo! Well done! Maya! Maya! Maya, where has he gone? Maya, where are you? Answer me! Maya, answer me! Answer! I'm Miss Cassandra. What are you saying? What's all the shouting about? If you don't answer right now. If you happen to look for that spoiled brat who nearly knocked us over as we passed, you'll find him there. Why are you talking so much nonsense? Maya! I ought to take this opportunity and spank you now that you can't move. Oops! Well, I'll tell you one thing, my dear. My child, since you do not want to obey me in anything, I will punish you and put you to bed immediately. Oh, that is necessary! I have done nothing wrong, I only wanted to have a quick laugh. But look, where are we going to get to if everyone does what they like? Just so you know, I do not like curious children. Well, well, that is enough. And I recommend that you keep very still and go to sleep. Well, perhaps I was wrong to run away, but why? If I want to know what I look like... How much of the outside world is there? Is it so bad? I know what I'm going to do. Next time I'll be more careful so I don't get caught. That's it, I'll do it. Yes, sir."

Listen for the voice of God.  then follow it and know that in time you will find your salvation. You're wrong. He just totally snapped. Really? Is that what you said? Yagami, are you still with us? Can you please translate the following sentence into English? Wow. This is amazing. Follow the teachings of God and receive His blessings, and so it shall be that the seas will again become bountiful and the raging storms will subside. Today at approximately 11 a.m., a 32-year-old  man was found stabbed to death in his apartment in the city of Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture. Kanagawa police are treating this case as homicide. In other news, today's suspected murderer Naoki Kofuji was arrested in the district of Shibuya, Tokyo. He is being held in custody facing murder charges for the brutal slaying of his common law partner, who was only 25 at the time of her death. Day in and day out, the same news on permanent...  Pete, this is all so ridiculous. This world is rotting. Another noticeable consequence is the extinction of many species on the planet. Species are now becoming extinct at a faster rate than has ever occurred in our recorded history.  I love you.  Death Note? As in a notebook of death? How do you use it? The human whose name is written in this notebook shall die. That's pretty lame. Not to mention twisted. It's really not that different from one of those chain letters you get. The human whose name is written in this notebook shall die? Come on.  There must be something wrong with me to even consider it. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his or her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected. If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.  If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds. Hmm. So depending on the person you have in mind, you can either kill them easily or painfully, huh? This is pretty detailed for a prank, I'll give them that. Hmm. So I write a name in that person's name.  dies. Like anyone would believe that. Wait. On the off chance someone really dies, would that make me a murderer? Yeah, right. It's completely impossible.  The same assailant who attacked six people at a busy shopping district in Shinjuku yesterday has struck again, taking eight people hostage at this daycare center. His captives include both children and teachers. The police have now identified the suspect as 42-year-old Kuro Otoharada, currently unemployed. We expect negotiations to begin immediately. A heart attack in 40 seconds? We'll see. At the present time, that's all the police are telling us.  You can't help but feel concerned for the safety of those hostages. You're absolutely right. We'll continue to monitor the situation from here. Thank you for that report. What do you make of this, Mr. Hashimoto? Well, one can only hope for a quick resolution to this situation. Looks like the notebook doesn't work. Oh well, I didn't expect it to anyway. Wait, we're seeing something here. Looks like movement at the front entrance. The hostages are coming out, and they all look to be unharmed.  The special forces are taking action. They're moving in. We don't know if the suspect's been arrested. Huh? Yes? Okay, we now have confirmation. The suspect has been found dead inside. I repeat, the suspect is now dead. Dead? Dead? The special forces are denying allegations that they shot the suspect. So it's quite possible he was feeling cornered and decided to commit suicide? Well, according to statements from the hostages, the suspect just suddenly collapsed. A heart attack?  No way. It's coincidence. This has to be a coincidence. Bye. It's already 6.30, you know. Don't you have cram school tonight? Yeah, I'll be ready in just a sec. Death note. It's unlikely, but if by chance this thing is for real, I have to test it one more time. In which case, it should probably be another criminal. But if he's too well known, that's...  That'll be a problem. If he dies, there's a good possibility the news of his death will be covered up. I need to see results right away. Hey, real buddy. What is it, Sudo? Didn't you want to lend me $20? What? Again? But I can't do that. Sudo. Maybe I should try killing him. No. I should definitely avoid killing people I know. Then again, does it even really matter? I mean, would anyone really care if a guy like you  like him was to disappear one day? Sweet! Looks like we'll be hanging at the arcade after school. Hey, Austin, we're having a speed dating party tomorrow. You want to come? Yeah, of course! Oh, there's no way I'm missing that. Damn it! Why is my mom so useless? She's never here to pick me up on time! Once you actually start looking around, it makes you wonder if you'd be doing society a favor by getting rid of all these people. Hey, baby!  Where are you going? Come have a little fun with us. That's our Taku for you. This guy could spot Hadi a mile away. What's up, little lady? The name's Tako Shibuimaru. What do you say? Come hang out with us, pretty lady. Please, I don't want any trouble. You hear that? She doesn't want trouble. Isn't that cute? Let's go, boys. Strip her down right here. Are you sure? No! Stop!  Please! Help me! Now, what will happen? No! No! Hey! Wait up! Don't look out! No! No! No! No! No! That settles it. The Death Note. It's for real. Oh, man!  Sakulo! Stupid kid! He just came out of nowhere! Now then, I better get going. It's been five days. Now then, I better get going.  You headed somewhere, Ryuk? Hate to tell you, but our whole world looks like this. That's true, but I've dropped my death note. You really messed things up, didn't you? Hold on a sec. Didn't you already trick the old man to get a second book? Don't tell me you dropped both of them. You must have some idea where you dropped the thing. Yeah. The human world. What?  Ahhhhhhhhhhh! What a nice surprise. I wasn't expecting you home so early. Yeah.  Hi, Mom. It's because... Oh, the results of the nationwide exams. I've been waiting all day. Here. Goodness! Number one again! These are the highest scores you've had. Yeah, I guess. I'm going to study in my room, so please don't interrupt me, okay? As you wish. Oh, Light. Do you want anything at all, dear? You can ask for whatever you like. No, I'm fine, Mom. Thanks, though.  I've already got what I want. You've taken quite a liking to it.  No reason to act surprised. I am the Shinigami Ryuk. That used to be my notebook. Judging by your laughter, you've already figured out that what you have is no ordinary notebook. Shinigami. A god of death, huh? Well, I'm not surprised. In fact...  Ryuk, I've been waiting... for you. Oh? I've already figured out that this Death Note I found is real. It didn't take me long. And now that I've witnessed the proof of its power, I only feel more confident in what I'm gonna do. That's interesting. I certainly wasn't expecting this. Several Death Notes have made their way into the human world in the past, but you're the first to have written this many names. Look at him.  How many people you've killed in only five days? Most are reluctant to write this much. I've already prepared myself, Ryuk. I used the notebook even though I knew it belonged to a Shinigami. And now that Shinigami has come. So what'll happen to me? You're here to take my soul, right? Huh? What do you mean? Is that some fantasy you humans came up with? I'm not gonna do anything to you. The notebook becomes part of the human realm from the very beginning.  moment it touches the earth. In other words, the notebook is now yours. This is mine? If you don't want it, just give it to someone else. But if you give it away, I'd have no choice but to erase your memories of the notebook. So then, you're saying I can use the Death Note all I want and I won't be punished? Let's just say this. You will feel the fear and pain known only to humans who've used the notebook. And when it's your time to die...  it will fall on me to write your name in my death note. Be warned, any human who's used a death note can neither go to heaven nor hell for eternity. That's all. Now you have something to look forward to after you die. Light? It'll be all right. Answer it.  What is it? I thought you'd like some apples. The neighbors brought them over for us. Why on earth is it so dark in your room? You ruin your eyesight. What's going on? Mom can't see him? That notebook you found originally belonged to me. And since you're now using it, you are the only one who's able to see me. And of course, my voice can only be heard by you. In other words, the Death Note is the bomb.  between Light, the human, and Ryuk, the Shinigami. Yum. I just have one more question I want to ask you. Why was I chosen for this? Hey, are you even listening? Apples in the human world are worth the trip. What's the best way to describe these? You see? Just answer my question. I didn't choose you. Don't you see this?  This is all just an accident. You actually thought you were chosen because you're so smart or something? Don't be so vain. It just happened to fall around here and you just happened to pick it up. And that's all there is to it. That's why I wrote the instructions in English, the most popular language in the human world. Then why did you drop it in the first place? You even wrote down specific instructions. So don't try to tell me this was an accident. You're asking me why? I did it because I was bored. Why?  You were bored? The truth is, Shinigami haven't got much to do these days. Most of the time we're either taking naps or gambling. If you take the time to write names in your death note, the others just laugh at you for working so hard. Even if you wrote the name of another Shinigami, it'd be pointless because they wouldn't die. And since we live in the Shinigami realm, it brings us no amusement to kill those in the human world either. So I figured I'd have more fun if I came down here.  myself. Anyway, I'm surprised at how many names you've written. But I want to know why you only wrote the cause of death for that guy who was hit by the truck. If you don't write down the cause of death, the victim dies of a heart attack. And that's probably the best thing about the death note, Ryuk. You see, I've already exhausted the list of the world's major criminals, and eventually I'm gonna get rid of them all. What's the point of doing that? It's only a matter of time before people figure out  out that these criminals are being eliminated by someone. I want the world to know of my existence, that there's someone out there passing righteous judgment on the wicked. Why even bother? What are you trying to achieve by passing judgment on them? I mean, why do you care? Because I've been bored too. I wasn't ready to believe it at first, but it's obvious now. There's something about the death note.  itself that makes humans want to try it out at least once. I killed them both. I really... I killed two men. Those were human lives. It won't be overlooked. Besides, who am I to pass judgment on others? No, no, wait. Maybe I'm wrong. This is exactly what I've been thinking about lately. This world is rotting, and those who are making it  Rot deserved to die. Someone has to do it, so why not me? Even if it means sacrificing my own mind and soul, it's worth it. Because the world can't go on like this. I wonder, what if someone else had picked up this notebook? Is there anyone out there other than me who'd be willing to eliminate the vermin from the world? If I don't do it, then who will? That's just it, there's no one. But I can do it. In fact, I'm...  I'm the only one who can. I'll do it. Using the Death Note, I'll change the world.  At first, I wrote the names of the worst criminals I could think of, like I was cleaning up the world one name at a time, so that eventually no one will ever do anything evil again. And while the truly guilty ones who deserve to be punished for their crimes die of heart attacks, the people who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones  who are less guilty but who still make trouble for others, will slowly be erased through disease and accidental death. Then, and only then, the world will start moving in the right direction. It'll be a new world, free of injustice and populated by people who I've judged to be honest, kind, and hardworking. But if you did that, it would make you the only bad person left. Huh? I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm a hardworking honor student who's considered to be one of Japan's best and brightest.  And I... I will become the god of this new world. It's just as I thought. Humans are so interesting. memememememememememe \u3054\u8996\u8074\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f  I'll show the world what happens when you try to cross me The entire world is watching now El",

Hey there, Ryuk. Would it kill you to join us? You should come play with us for a change. No. I'll pass. Listen for the voice of God. then follow it and know that in time you will find your salvation. You're wrong. He just totally snapped. Really? Is that what you said? Yagami, are you still with us? Can you please translate the following sentence into English? Wow. This is amazing. Follow the teachings of God and receive His blessings, and so it shall be that the seas will again become bountiful and the raging storms will subside. Today at approximately 11 a.m., a 32-year-old man was found stabbed to death in his apartment in the city of Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture. Kanagawa police are treating this case as homicide. In other news, today's suspected murderer Naoki Kofuji was arrested in the district of Shibuya, Tokyo. He is being held in custody facing murder charges for the brutal slaying of his common law partner, who was only 25 at the time of her death. Day in and day out, the same news on permanent... Pete, this is all so ridiculous. This world is rotting. Another noticeable consequence is the extinction of many species on the planet. Species are now becoming extinct at a faster rate than has ever occurred in our recorded history. I love you. Death Note? As in a notebook of death? How do you use it? The human whose name is written in this notebook shall die. That's pretty lame. Not to mention twisted. It's really not that different from one of those chain letters you get. The human whose name is written in this notebook shall die? Come on. There must be something wrong with me to even consider it. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his or her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected. If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds. Hmm. So depending on the person you have in mind, you can either kill them easily or painfully, huh? This is pretty detailed for a prank, I'll give them that. Hmm. So I write a name in that person's name. dies. Like anyone would believe that. Wait. On the off chance someone really dies, would that make me a murderer? Yeah, right. It's completely impossible. The same assailant who attacked six people at a busy shopping district in Shinjuku yesterday has struck again, taking eight people hostage at this daycare center. His captives include both children and teachers. The police have now identified the suspect as 42-year-old Kuro Otoharada, currently unemployed. We expect negotiations to begin immediately. A heart attack in 40 seconds? We'll see. At the present time, that's all the police are telling us. You can't help but feel concerned for the safety of those hostages. You're absolutely right. We'll continue to monitor the situation from here. Thank you for that report. What do you make of this, Mr. Hashimoto? Well, one can only hope for a quick resolution to this situation. Looks like the notebook doesn't work. Oh well, I didn't expect it to anyway. Wait, we're seeing something here. Looks like movement at the front entrance. The hostages are coming out, and they all look to be unharmed. The special forces are taking action. They're moving in. We don't know if the suspect's been arrested. Huh? Yes? Okay, we now have confirmation. The suspect has been found dead inside. I repeat, the suspect is now dead. Dead? Dead? The special forces are denying allegations that they shot the suspect. So it's quite possible he was feeling cornered and decided to commit suicide? Well, according to statements from the hostages, the suspect just suddenly collapsed. A heart attack? No way. It's coincidence. This has to be a coincidence. Bye. It's already 6.30, you know. Don't you have cram school tonight? Yeah, I'll be ready in just a sec. Death note. It's unlikely, but if by chance this thing is for real, I have to test it one more time. In which case, it should probably be another criminal. But if he's too well known, that's... That'll be a problem. If he dies, there's a good possibility the news of his death will be covered up. I need to see results right away. Hey, real buddy. What is it, Sudo? Didn't you want to lend me $20? What? Again? But I can't do that. Sudo. Maybe I should try killing him. No. I should definitely avoid killing people I know. Then again, does it even really matter? I mean, would anyone really care if a guy like you like him was to disappear one day? Sweet! Looks like we'll be hanging at the arcade after school. Hey, Austin, we're having a speed dating party tomorrow. You want to come? Yeah, of course! Oh, there's no way I'm missing that. Damn it! Why is my mom so useless? She's never here to pick me up on time! Once you actually start looking around, it makes you wonder if you'd be doing society a favor by getting rid of all these people. Hey, baby! Where are you going? Come have a little fun with us. That's our Taku for you. This guy could spot Hadi a mile away. What's up, little lady? The name's Tako Shibuimaru. What do you say? Come hang out with us, pretty lady. Please, I don't want any trouble. You hear that? She doesn't want trouble. Isn't that cute? Let's go, boys. Strip her down right here. Are you sure? No! Stop! Please! Help me! Now, what will happen? No! No! Hey! Wait up! Don't look out! No! No! No! No! No! That settles it. The Death Note. It's for real. Oh, man! Sakulo! Stupid kid! He just came out of nowhere! Now then, I better get going. It's been five days. Now then, I better get going. You headed somewhere, Ryuk? Hate to tell you, but our whole world looks like this. That's true, but I've dropped my death note. You really messed things up, didn't you? Hold on a sec. Didn't you already trick the old man to get a second book? Don't tell me you dropped both of them. You must have some idea where you dropped the thing. Yeah. The human world. What? Ahhhhhhhhhhh! What a nice surprise. I wasn't expecting you home so early. Yeah. Hi, Mom. It's because... Oh, the results of the nationwide exams. I've been waiting all day. Here. Goodness! Number one again! These are the highest scores you've had. Yeah, I guess. I'm going to study in my room, so please don't interrupt me, okay? As you wish. Oh, Light. Do you want anything at all, dear? You can ask for whatever you like. No, I'm fine, Mom. Thanks, though. I've already got what I want. You've taken quite a liking to it. No reason to act surprised. I am the Shinigami Ryuk. That used to be my notebook. Judging by your laughter, you've already figured out that what you have is no ordinary notebook. Shinigami. A god of death, huh? Well, I'm not surprised. In fact... Ryuk, I've been waiting... for you. Oh? I've already figured out that this Death Note I found is real. It didn't take me long. And now that I've witnessed the proof of its power, I only feel more confident in what I'm gonna do. That's interesting. I certainly wasn't expecting this. Several Death Notes have made their way into the human world in the past, but you're the first to have written this many names. Look at him. How many people you've killed in only five days? Most are reluctant to write this much. I've already prepared myself, Ryuk. I used the notebook even though I knew it belonged to a Shinigami. And now that Shinigami has come. So what'll happen to me? You're here to take my soul, right? Huh? What do you mean? Is that some fantasy you humans came up with? I'm not gonna do anything to you. The notebook becomes part of the human realm from the very beginning. moment it touches the earth. In other words, the notebook is now yours. This is mine? If you don't want it, just give it to someone else. But if you give it away, I'd have no choice but to erase your memories of the notebook. So then, you're saying I can use the Death Note all I want and I won't be punished? Let's just say this. You will feel the fear and pain known only to humans who've used the notebook. And when it's your time to die... it will fall on me to write your name in my death note. Be warned, any human who's used a death note can neither go to heaven nor hell for eternity. That's all. Now you have something to look forward to after you die. Light? It'll be all right. Answer it. What is it? I thought you'd like some apples. The neighbors brought them over for us. Why on earth is it so dark in your room? You ruin your eyesight. What's going on? Mom can't see him? That notebook you found originally belonged to me. And since you're now using it, you are the only one who's able to see me. And of course, my voice can only be heard by you. In other words, the Death Note is the bomb. between Light, the human, and Ryuk, the Shinigami. Yum. I just have one more question I want to ask you. Why was I chosen for this? Hey, are you even listening? Apples in the human world are worth the trip. What's the best way to describe these? You see? Just answer my question. I didn't choose you. Don't you see this? This is all just an accident. You actually thought you were chosen because you're so smart or something? Don't be so vain. It just happened to fall around here and you just happened to pick it up. And that's all there is to it. That's why I wrote the instructions in English, the most popular language in the human world. Then why did you drop it in the first place? You even wrote down specific instructions. So don't try to tell me this was an accident. You're asking me why? I did it because I was bored. Why? You were bored? The truth is, Shinigami haven't got much to do these days. Most of the time we're either taking naps or gambling. If you take the time to write names in your death note, the others just laugh at you for working so hard. Even if you wrote the name of another Shinigami, it'd be pointless because they wouldn't die. And since we live in the Shinigami realm, it brings us no amusement to kill those in the human world either. So I figured I'd have more fun if I came down here. myself.

Wo immer ein R\u00e4tsel zu l\u00f6sen ist, hoch in dem alten Schloss oder im Schwung, ja, Mest, f\u00fcnf Freunde, das sind wir. Julian, Dick und M, George und Tim, wie der Hund.  Und f\u00fcnf Freunde, das sind wir. Wir kommen schnell herbei, von immer hier ist Wolf. Und schon sind wir da.  Na, wie weit sind Sie, Mr. Rogers? Gleich fertig, Mrs. Kirin. Gut. George! George! Mach dich doch bitte schon mal fertig! Und vielleicht r\u00e4umst du auch dein Zimmer auf, Sie m\u00fcssen jetzt...  Ich will jeden Moment hier sein. Wie weit ist es noch, Julia? Vielleicht noch eine Meile. Vom Bahnhof aus sind wir ungef\u00e4hr f\u00fcnf Meilen gefahren. Ist ja nicht zu glauben. Endlich geht es mal bergab. Ist ja irre sch\u00f6n hier, was? Ja, ja, eine tolle Luft. Oh, guck doch mal das Meer. Das da dr\u00fcben ist bestimmt Cairn Island. Ja, m\u00fcsste es eigentlich. Was ist denn das f\u00fcr ein komischer Turm? Keine Ahnung.  Aber Ginny wei\u00df das bestimmt. Los, wir wollen wenigstens p\u00fcnktlich sein. George! Georgina! Also wirklich Georgina. Georgina! Komm her!  Das muss es sein. Los! Los! Entschuldigen Sie bitte. Ist das die Karen Cottage? Wieso willst du das wissen? Wir sind Verwandte von Georgina. Wie?  Ihre Mutter hat uns eingeladen. So eine lause Bande hat Professor Kirin noch gefehlt. Und drei mehr, die herumwimmeln, L\u00e4rm machen und ihn bei der Arbeit st\u00f6ren. Er hat verdammtes Gl\u00fcck, dass er meistens auf der Insel ist. Dann hat er wohl diesen komischen Turm gebaut. Ja, hat was mit seinem Experiment zu tun. Ist aber streng geheim, klar? Also seht euch vor und plaudert nicht mit fremden Leuten dar\u00fcber. Und lasst euch ja nicht in einem meiner Gem\u00fcsebeete erwischen.  Ach, da seid ihr ja. Ist aber sch\u00f6n, euch mal wiederzusehen. Tag, Tante Fanny. Ihr seid vielleicht gewachsen, seit ich euch das letzte Mal gesehen habe. Anne war damals noch ein Baby. Wartet mal, du m\u00fcsstest Julian sein und das ist Dick. Na, wie war die Reise? Einfach klasse, Tante Fanny. Die Fahrt vom Bahnhof hierher war doch prima. Ja, na gut. Ich habe beim Bahnhof angerufen, euer Gep\u00e4ck wird hergebracht. Stellt die Fahrr\u00e4der hinters Haus, gleich gibt es Tee. Ihr habt doch bestimmt auch Hunger.  Und Sie, stell dir vor, die beiden w\u00e4ren beinahe vom Rad gefallen. Besonders Andy war so schwach, dass er sich immer den Kopf gehalten hat. Der fehlt irgendwie Vitamine. Immer muss diese bl\u00f6de Witze machen. Ja, ja, eure Mutter hat mir schon gesagt, dass ihr solche Scherze treibt. Dann l\u00e4sst man jetzt gar nicht hin, dann wird er von selbst. Wunderbarer Nachmittag, Herr Johnson. Wunderbarer Nachmittag. Ja, muss ich auch sagen, Mr. Johnson. Ich hoffe, Sie haben gut gespeist. Passabel. Es wurde nur ein bisschen zu viel geredet.  Es wird Zeit f\u00fcr eine sch\u00f6ne Tasse B\u00fcrotee. Oh ja. Ja. \u00c4h, Miss Peters, ich muss unvorhergesehenerweise f\u00fcr ein paar Tage wegfahren.  Ich bin sicher, der Minister wird bis zu meiner R\u00fcckkehr auch ohne mich auskommen. Lassen Sie bitte den Wagen vorfahren, Miss Peters. Ja, Mr. Johnson. Dankesch\u00f6n. Ich habe mir gedacht, morgen fahren wir alle auf die Insel und essen zu Mittag mit Onkel Quentin. Klasse! Wo ist denn Georgina, Tante Fanny? Wir haben uns schon so auf sie gefreut. Wei\u00df auch nicht, wo sie ist.  sie ist. Also George verschwindet immer gerade dann, wenn sie es nicht soll. Aber wieso nennst du sie George? Sie will es so. Aber jeder denkt dann, sie ist ein Junge und kein M\u00e4dchen. Anscheinend will sie es nicht anders. Also ich m\u00f6chte nicht, dass man denkt, ich w\u00e4re ein Junge. Nein, nat\u00fcrlich nicht. Aber du bist ja auch nicht wie George. Ach, dass du dich auch mal sehen l\u00e4sst. Wir haben fast alles aufgegessen. Ich habe keinen Hunger. Danke, Mutter. Willst du nicht guten Tag sagen? Das sind N, Dick und Julian. Hallo. Tag.  Hallo. Hallo. Warum gehst du nicht mit ihnen raus, George, und zeigst ihnen ein bisschen die Gegend? Aber ich muss doch noch... Ja, was? Was musst du? Nichts. Dann ist's ja gut. Also ab mit euch. Ich r\u00e4um den Tisch ab. Danke f\u00fcr den Tee, Tante Fanny. Der Honig war auch ganz gut. Viel Spa\u00df, Kinder. H\u00f6rt mal. Hm? Kommt nicht zu sp\u00e4t zur\u00fcck. Nein, nein.  Tante Fanny hat gesagt, wir wollen morgen auf Onkel Quentys Insel fahren. Findest du das nicht klasse, Georgina? Mein Name ist nicht Georgina, ich hei\u00dfe George. Und die Insel geh\u00f6rt nicht ihm, sondern mir. Was regst du dich denn gleich auf? Sie geh\u00f6rt mir. Er hat sie mir geschenkt. Und jetzt arbeitet er da und l\u00e4sst mich \u00fcberhaupt nicht mehr hin. Aber wenn seine Arbeit ein so gro\u00dfes Geheimnis ist, warum macht er sie dann an einem Ort, wo jeder hinkommen kann, wenn er will? Du kannst es ja mal versuchen.  und die Klippen vor der Insel machen aus deinem Boot Kleinholz. Nur Vater und ich wissen, wie man da durchkommt. Er ist dort, weil er dicke Zeiten f\u00fcr seine Experimente braucht. Deshalb ist er auf meiner Insel. Also das f\u00e4nde ich auch prima, in einer eigenen Insel zu arbeiten. H\u00f6rt mal, ich habe jetzt was zu erledigen. Das geht nur mich was an, verstanden? Also kommt mir blo\u00df nicht hinterhergeschlichen, keiner von euch. Wir haben was Besseres zu tun. Das kann ja lustig werden mit dir. Na, f\u00fcr euch ist es ja nicht weiter schlimm, aber ich muss mit dir in einem Zimmer schlafen. Ich sage euch, das werden bestimmt zwei verdammt lange Wochen dauern.  Wochen f\u00fcr uns. Darf ich Ihnen noch eins bringen? Warum nicht, wenn Sie es bezahlen, gerne. Oh, das w\u00e4re mir ein Vergn\u00fcgen. Bitte? Danke. Timmy! Timmy! Oh, komm Timmy, komm! Na los, komm!  Na komm, mein Kleiner. Och, Timmy. Das ist die Kleine von Quentin Curran, nicht wahr? Ja. Sie ist wilder als ein Junge. Und die meisten hier sagen nur George zu ihr. Zum Wohl. Zum Wohl. Und das da ist ihr Hund. Der Professor.  wollte den Hund nicht im Haus haben. Sie sollte ihn weggeben, aber an dem K\u00f6ter h\u00e4ngt sie mehr als an allem anderen. Sagen Sie, wo ist Quentin jetzt? Ich habe ihn lange nicht mehr gesehen. Er hat sich fast v\u00f6llig auf die Insel zur\u00fcckgezogen, experimentiert. Er kommt \u00fcberhaupt nicht mehr r\u00fcber. Seine Frau bringt alles, was er braucht, zur Insel r\u00fcber. Vorher muss sie aber immer erst signalisieren, dass alles in Ordnung ist. Dann blinkt er dreimal vom Turm mit einer Taschenlampe. Jeden Morgen und jeden Abend um elf, danach k\u00f6nnen sie ihre Uhr stellen. Jeder hat seine Marotten. Ist das nicht verr\u00fcckt, so viel zu arbeiten?  Los, komm, hier gef\u00e4llt's mir. Wenn sich Georgina nur nicht so furchtbar bl\u00f6d benehmen w\u00fcrde. Sag blo\u00df George zu ihr. Wenn sie zuletzt oben ist, muss morgen das Eis bezahlen. Das sagst du nur, weil ich sowieso verliere.  Sieht hier aber sehr einsam aus. Hey, seht mal. Sieht aus, als w\u00e4re das eine gro\u00dfe H\u00f6hle. Kommt mal her. Da kann man nicht viel sehen. Kommt, wir gehen mal tiefer rein. Wir k\u00f6nnen doch nicht ohne Taschenlampe reingehen. Gut, dann gehen wir eben zur\u00fcck und holen uns eine. Daf\u00fcr reicht die Zeit nicht. Wisst ihr was, wir kommen morgen nochmal her und untersuchen sie.  dann klar die l\u00e4uft uns ja nicht weg wartet mal wir behalten das aber f\u00fcr uns ja dort hat ihr geheimnis und diese h\u00f6hle ist unser geheimnis okay hallo kinder ihr seid doch zu besuch auf karen kottisch nicht wahr ja das stimmt ist george nicht mitgekommen nein  Euer Onkel und eure Tante sind gute Freunde von mir. Wollt ihr morgen nicht bei mir Tee trinken? Naja, ich wei\u00df noch nicht, was wir morgen... Naja, ist ja egal. Kommt, wenn ihr Lust habt. Ich w\u00fcrde mich freuen. Auf Wiedersehen. Komischer Kauz. Das Wimmelt hier nur so von merkw\u00fcrdigen Leuten. Tante Fanny ist der einzig normale Mensch, der mir hier bisher begegnet ist. Onkel Quentin scheint ja wohl auch ein bisschen komisch zu sein.  Wenn wir morgen feststellen, wenn wir r\u00fcberfahren auf die Insel, nicht wahr? Darf ich hudern, George? Nein, die Klippen sind zu gef\u00e4hrlich, aber ablegen darfst du.  Da sitzen Kinder. Vater! Vater! Ist der immer in seinem Turm, Tante Penny? Nein, wenn wir ihn rufen, kommt er meistens sofort.  George, nimm die Jungs mit und seht, ob ihr ihn findet. Okay, komm. Ich freu mich schon aufs Essen. Vater! Vater! Mann, sowas hab ich ja noch nie gesehen. Seht euch das an! Sag mal, George, wei\u00dft du, was das f\u00fcr Dinger sind da oben am Turm? Ich k\u00f6nnte mir vorstellen, dass das irgendwas mit Sonnenenergie zu tun hat. Die Reflektoren oder wie das hei\u00dft, stehen vielleicht woanders.  Vater! Vater! Er ist wohl nicht da oben. Irgendwo muss er doch sein. Hier bin ich!  Professor Curran. Ihre Insel scheint ja ziemliche Aufmerksamkeit zu errichten.  Du bist gewachsen seit dem letzten Mal. Das war vor acht Jahren, Onkel Quentin. Ach wirklich? Dann war es ja wohl zu erwarten, oder was meint ihr? Wo treibst du dich denn im Moment auf der Insel rum? In den Kellern. In den Kellern? Unter den Ruinen, die Keller vom alten Schloss. Sag mal, ist das dein Geheimlabor? Ja, ja, wenn man will, kann man es.  zu nennen k\u00fcmmert sich georgia anst\u00e4ndig um euch sie hat uns raus gerudert um die gef\u00e4hrlichen klippen rum alle achtung die kann rudern besser als ein junge wei\u00df so jetzt muss ich erst mal zur\u00fcck ich habe da noch was zu kontrollieren danke f\u00fcr den nachschub george du kannst deine insel bald zur\u00fcck haben ich bin so gut wie fertig und vergisst die signale nicht ich mache mir sonst noch nicht denkt dran  Am\u00fcsiert euch noch gut. Also dann, Wiedersehen. Wiedersehen. Sieh da, sieh da. Eine reizende \u00dcberraschung, Sie wiederzusehen, Curtin. Johnson. Ich nehme an, Sie beobachten seltene Wasserv\u00f6gel, nicht wahr? Was f\u00fcr ein hervorragendes Teleskop. Ja, das ist der...  ein ausgezeichnetes Fernrohr. Ach, sagen Sie mir, f\u00fcr wen arbeiten Sie denn diesmal? Russland, China, Amerika? Damals, als wir uns das letzte Mal begegneten, waren Sie f\u00fcr uns sehr unbequem, K\u00f6rten. Ich hoffe, dass Sie sich dar\u00fcber klar sind. H\u00f6ren Sie, ich arbeite f\u00fcr niemanden. Ich gebe Ihnen mein Wort. Ihr Wort. Ach, wenn das kein Funkger\u00e4t ist, will ich sofort tot umfallen. So, das reicht. Bitte.  Schickt eure Schwimmwesten rein, ja? So, und du tr\u00e4gst das. So, komm, Kinder. George, was machst du denn heute Nachmittag? Das ist ja wohl meine Sache. Ich habe nur gedacht, weil wir etwas Interessantes gefunden haben. Was denn? Das ist unser Geheimnis. Wir sind hinter dem H\u00fcgel am Ende vom Strand. Du kannst es dir ja nochmal \u00fcberlegen. Es ist wirklich eine tolle Sache, was wir da gefunden haben. George, komm!  Ich verstehe Sie nicht, Curtin, dass Sie mit denen wieder Gesch\u00e4fte machen. Hallo? Karner? Herr Johnson, wie sch\u00f6n, mal wieder Ihre Stimme zu h\u00f6ren. Ich habe das Gef\u00fchl, Ihre T\u00e4tigkeit ist in ein unangenehmes Stadium getreten, mein Verehrter. Pech f\u00fcr Sie. Ach, \u00fcbrigens noch was. Sie werden Mr. Curtin auf der Frequenz nicht mehr empfangen. Johnson, h\u00f6ren Sie!  Wir sind sich wohl dar\u00fcber klark\u00f6rten, dass sie Unannehmlichkeiten bekommen. Zuerst einmal werden wir beide uns gr\u00fcndlich unterhalten. Ich glaube, hier ist schon ewig keiner mehr gewesen. Man kann nicht mal das Ende sehen. Hier muss unheimlich weit rein gehen. Kommt! Das ist keine H\u00f6hle. Das ist ein Tunnel, den irgendjemand gebaut hat. Der ist ja unheimlich lang.  Er geht sicher weiter bis unten ans Meer. Was ist denn das? Das ist ein Hund. Hey, wer bist du denn? Wem der wo geh\u00f6rt? Keine Ahnung, vielleicht irgendjemanden am Strand. Timmy! Timmy, wo bist du? Das ist doch George. Ich h\u00f6re wohl nicht richtig. Das ist also ihr tolles Geheimnis. Kommt! Timmy, wie oft habe ich dir schon gesagt, dass du keine Kaninchen jagen sollst? F\u00fchlt sich nicht gef\u00e4hrlich an, wenn ich dir was sage.  Mach denn ein artiger Hund sowas? Du bist ein ganz schlimmer. Komm jetzt! Muss man dir denn alles tausendmal sagen? Hallo George. Dick. Das ist also Timmy. Woher wei\u00dft du denn seinen Namen? Du hast ihn doch gerade gerufen. Der hat uns einen gro\u00dfen Schreck eingejagt. Der ist ja wirklich s\u00fc\u00df, George. Geh\u00f6rt er dir? Ja. Und warum haben wir ihn noch nicht im Haus gesehen? Vater hat mir verboten, ihn zu behalten, aber ein Junge im Dorf versorgt ihn f\u00fcr mich. Ich w\u00fcrde lieber verhungern, als dass ich ihn weggeben w\u00fcrde. Und au\u00dferdem halte ich es um.  ihn auch nicht aus. Ach, jetzt kapier ich das. Deshalb haust du also so viel ab. Aber du brauchst keine Angst zu haben. Wir verraten dein Geheimnis nicht. Ganz bestimmt nicht, George. Verspricht er mir das? Ja, wir versprechen es. Uns gef\u00e4llt dir doch genauso gut wie dir. Ja. Freunde? Freunde. Ich fand das sowieso nicht gut, dass wir Feinde waren. Was ich dir noch sagen wollte, George, der Tunnel, den wir gefunden haben, das ist kein normaler Tunnel. Sehr weit sind wir nicht gekommen, aber wir haben ein paar Stufen gefunden. Ja, die f\u00fchren direkt in die Erde. Und in Richtung Tumir.  raus kommst du mit na klar kommt hallo kinder aber es ist nun mit meiner einladung gehen wir lieber bevor er uns fragt was sie hier unten suchen ja ich habe sowieso hunger okay wir kommen macht euch bequem dann setzt euch schuldig das ist ein bisschen unaufger\u00e4umt ist  Seht euch mal das Fernrohr an. Oh ja, das ist mein Hobby. Ich beobachte V\u00f6gel. Karen Island. Oh, ich kann ja Onkel Quentins Turm ganz deutlich sehen. Eine Art Raben. Pyrokorax. Seltene K\u00fcstenv\u00f6gel. Ein paar davon habe ich auf der Insel ersp\u00e4ht. Tja, und euch habe ich nat\u00fcrlich auch gesehen. Na, wie geht es denn deinem Vater? Meinem Vater? Ach ja. Er ist fast fertig, hat er gesagt. Ach, ist er das? Ja. Der gute alte Quentin. \u00c4h, nun ja. Vielleicht k\u00f6nntet ihr mir helfen, den Tisch zu decken. Ein bisschen Kuchen und Kekse.  sind dort drin ich mache inzwischen den t nicht da oben du findest alles in dem unteren fach mein junge entschuldigung ach du meine g\u00fcte die tante ich meine meine tante tante john sie kommt zum tee habt ihr das vergessen sie kennen sie doch sicher so ja nat\u00fcrlich ja die tage ist wirklich reizend leider gleich weg tut mir leid auf wiedersehen und vielen dank  Tja, aber... Es war wirklich bl\u00f6d von uns. Entschuldigen Sie bitte. Trotzdem vielen Dank. Auf Wiedersehen. Na ja, dann vielleicht ein andermal. Wer ist denn Tante Joan? Wir haben \u00fcberhaupt keine Tante Joan. Nat\u00fcrlich nicht, aber trotzdem hat er gesagt, er kennt sie. Der tut nur so, als w\u00e4re er ein Freund von Vater. Aber ich habe den Kerl noch niemals vorher gesehen. Du h\u00e4ttest ihm nicht sagen d\u00fcrfen, dass Vater fast fertig ist. Du wei\u00dft genau, dass das geheim ist. Tut mir leid, George. Ich habe nicht daran gedacht. Meinst du nicht, du \u00fcbertreibst die Sache ein bisschen, George? Nein, nicht nicht.  Ich glaube, sie hat recht. Du hast bestimmt nicht gesehen, was in dem Schrank war. Da war ein Funkger\u00e4t, ein ziemlich gro\u00dfes. Oh Mann! Wirklich ausgezeichnet, Kirk. Nun ja, es tut mir leid. Sie waren so pl\u00f6tzlich weg. Ich konnte \u00fcberhaupt keine Fragen stellen. Ich habe alles geh\u00f6rt, was ich wissen wollte. Professor Kirin ist also, wie der Junge sagte, fast fertig. Nicht so verbissen, Kirk. Sie haben noch eine Menge vor heute Nacht.  Ja, vielleicht. Trotzdem glaube ich, dass wir uns viel zu viel Gedanken machen. Solange Onkel Quentin noch p\u00fcnktlich signalisiert. Es ist gleich halb elf. Ui, das Flugzeug fliegt aber tief. Das fliegt ja \u00fcber die Insel. Habt ihr sein Zeichen schon gesehen, Kinder? Nein, noch nicht. Muss jeden Moment kommen. Mach schon, Vater, los.  Los! Da! Eins, zwei, drei. Alles in Ordnung, George. Nichts passiert. Es ist alles in Ordnung, Tante Fanny. Gut. Jetzt ab ins Bett mit euch. Marsch, marsch. Puh, da bin ich aber erleichtert. Aber morgen fr\u00fch werde ich als erstes den Turm mit einem Fernglas beobachten. Gute Nacht. Gute Nacht. Nacht. Nacht.  Professor Kirin, nehme ich an. Wer zum Teufel sind Sie? Ich glaube kaum, dass Sie mich kennen. Mein Name ist Johnson. Ich bin vom Forschungsministerium. Gott sei Dank, Mr. Johnson. Im ersten Moment habe ich geglaubt, Sie w\u00e4ren so etwas wie ein... Oder sollte ich besser sagen, ich war beim Forschungsministerium. Denn k\u00fcrzlich...  habe ich beschlossen, ein eigenes Ministerium aufzumachen. Verstehen Sie? Und dies ist der Anfang, Professor. Der beste, den ich mir denken kann. Hier auf Kirin Island.  keine Gefahr entgegen. Vertraut auf uns, wir packen's an, wer kann uns widerstehen? F\u00fcnf Freunde, das sind wir. Julian, Dick und Ed, George und Tim, wie der Hund. F\u00fcnf Freunde, das sind wir. Wir kommen schnell herbei, wann immer ihr es wollt.  Wir kommen schnell herbei Und schon sind wir da Sind wir da",
        "translated": "Whenever an adventure is worthwhile, we know no fear or terror, because we are used to it. Wherever there is a puzzle to solve, high up in the old castle or in the swing, yes, Mest, five friends, that's us. Julian, Dick and M, George and Tim, like the dog. And we are five friends. We come quickly, Wolf is always here. And we are already here. Well, how are you, Mr. Rogers? Almost ready, Mrs. Kirin. Good. George! George! Please get ready! And maybe you should tidy your room too, you have to... I want to be here any minute. How far is it, Julia? Maybe another mile. We drove about five miles from the station. It's unbelievable. Finally, we're going downhill. It's so beautiful here, isn't it? Yes, yes, great air. Oh, just look at the sea. That over there must be Cairn Island. Yes, it should be. What kind of strange tower is that? I have no idea. But Ginny probably knows that. Come on, let's at least be on time. George! Georgina! Really, Georgina. Georgina! Come here! That must be it. Come on! Come on! Excuse me. Is this Karen Cottage? Why do you want to know? We're relatives of Georgina. What? Her mother invited us. Professor Kirin was missing a lousy bunch like that. And three more who swarm around, make noise and disturb him at work. He's damn lucky that he's on the island most of the time. Then he must have built this strange tower. Yes, it has something to do with his experiment. But it's top secret, right? So be careful and don't chat about it with strangers. And don't get caught in one of my vegetable patches. Oh, there you are. It's nice to see you again. Hello, Aunt Fanny. You've grown a lot since I last saw you. Anne was just a baby then. Wait a minute, you must be Julian and this is Dick. So, how was the trip? Simply brilliant, Aunt Fanny. The journey from the station here was great. Yes, fine. I've called the station, your luggage is being brought here. Put the bikes behind the house, there will be tea soon. I'm sure you're hungry too. And you, just imagine, the two of them nearly fell off their bikes. Andy in particular was so weak that he kept holding his head. He's somehow lacking vitamins. She always has to make stupid jokes. Yes, yes, your mother told me that you joke like that. Then you don't let it go, it will happen on its own. Wonderful afternoon, Mr Johnson. Wonderful afternoon. Yes, I must say, Mr Johnson. I hope you ate well. Passable. There was just a bit too much talking. Time for a nice cup of office tea. Oh yes. Yes. Er, Miss Peters, I have to go away for a few days unexpectedly. I'm sure the Minister will manage without me until I return. Please have the car brought forward, Miss Peters. Yes, Mr Johnson. Thank you. I thought we'd all go to the island tomorrow and have lunch with Uncle Quentin. Great! Where's Georgina, Aunt Fanny? We've been looking forward to seeing her. I don't know where she is either. she is. Well, George always disappears when she shouldn't. But why do you call her George? She wants it that way. But then everyone thinks she's a boy and not a girl. Apparently she doesn't want it any other way. Well, I don't want people to think I'm a boy. No, of course not. But you're not like George either. Oh, I hope you show yourself sometimes. We've eaten almost everything. I'm not hungry. Thank you, Mother. Don't you want to say hello? This is N, Dick and Julian. Hello. Day. Hello. Hello. Why don't you go out with them, George, and show them around? But I've got to... Well, what? What do you have to do? Nothing. That's all right then. Off you go. I'll clear the table. Thanks for the tea, Aunt Fanny. The honey was quite good too. Have fun, children. Listen. Hm? Don't be late back. No, no. Aunt Fanny said we're going to Uncle Quenty's island tomorrow. Don't you think that's great, Georgina? My name isn't Georgina, it's George. And the island isn't his, it's mine. Why are you so upset? It's mine. He gave it to me. And now he works there and won't let me go at all. But if his work is such a big secret, why does he do it in a place where anyone can go if they want to? You can try it. and the cliffs off the island will turn your boat into splinters. Only Father and I know how to get through there. He's there because he needs a lot of time for his experiments. That's why he's on my island. I think it would be great, too, to work on my own island. Listen, I've got something to do now. That's only my business, got it? So don't sneak up on me, none of you. We've got better things to do. This could be fun with you. Well, it's not so bad for you, but I have to sleep in the same room as you. I'm telling you, it's going to take a long two weeks. Weeks for us. Can I get you another one? Why not, if you pay for it, I'd be happy to. Oh, that would be my pleasure. Please? Thank you. Timmy! Timmy! Oh, come on Timmy, come on! Come on, come on! Come on, little one. Oh, Timmy. That's Quentin Curran's little one, isn't it? Yes. She's wilder than a boy. And most people here just call her George. Cheers. Cheers. And that's her dog. The professor. didn't want the dog in the house. She should give him away, but she's more attached to the mutt than anything else. Tell me, where is Quentin now? I haven't seen him for a long time. He's withdrawn almost completely to the island, experimenting. He doesn't come over at all anymore. His wife brings everything he needs over to the island. But first she always has to signal that everything is OK. Then he flashes a flashlight three times from the tower. Every morning and every evening at eleven, they can set their clocks by that. Everyone has their quirks. Isn't it crazy to work so much? Come on, I like it here. If only Georgina wouldn't behave so terribly stupidly. Just call her George. If she's last up, she'll have to pay for the ice cream tomorrow. You're only saying that because I'm losing anyway. It looks very lonely here. Hey, look. It looks like a big cave. Come here. You can't see much. Come on, let's go deeper. We can't go in without a flashlight. OK, let's go back and get one. We don't have time for that. You know what, we'll come back tomorrow and examine it. then of course she won't run away from us just wait a minute we'll keep it to ourselves yes there is her secret and this cave is our secret okay hello children you are visiting karen kottisch aren't you yes that's right didn't george come with you no Your uncle and aunt are good friends of mine. Would you like to come and have tea with me tomorrow? Well, I don't know what we're going to do tomorrow... Well, it doesn't matter. Come if you feel like it. I'd be delighted. Goodbye. Strange guy. This place is full of strange people. Aunt Fanny is the only normal person I've met here so far. Uncle Quentin seems to be a bit strange too. If we discover it tomorrow when we go over to the island, right? Can I brood, George? No, the cliffs are too dangerous, but you can cast off. There are children sitting there. Father! Father! Is he always in his tower, Aunt Penny? No, when we call him he usually comes straight away. George, take the boys and see if you can find him. OK, come on. I'm looking forward to dinner. Father! Father! Man, I've never seen anything like it. Look at that! Tell me, George, do you know what those things are up there on the tower? I imagine it has something to do with solar energy. The reflectors or whatever they're called might be somewhere else. Father! Father! He's probably not up there. He has to be somewhere. I'm here! Professor Curran. Your island seems to be attracting quite a bit of attention. You've grown since the last time. That was eight years ago, Uncle Quentin. Oh really? Then it was to be expected, don't you think? Where are you hanging out on the island at the moment? In the cellars. In the cellars? Under the ruins, the cellars of the old castle. Tell me, is that your secret laboratory? Yes, yes, if you want, you can. to name Georgia takes good care of you she rowed us out around the dangerous cliffs well done she can row better than a boy knows so now I have to go back I still have something to check thanks for the supplies George you can have your island back soon I'm as good as finished and don't forget the signals I'm not going to worry otherwise remember Have a good time. Well, bye then. Bye. Look, look. A delightful surprise to see you again, Curtin. Johnson. I suppose you are observing rare waterfowl, aren't you? What a splendid telescope. Yes, that is the... an excellent telescope. Oh, tell me, who are you working for this time? Russia, China, America? When we last met, you were very inconvenient for us, K\u00f6rten. I hope you are clear about that. Listen, I don't work for anyone. I give you my word. Your word. Oh, if that isn't a radio, I want to drop dead right now. That's enough. Please. Send in your life jackets, OK? There, and you wear this. Come on, kids. George, what are you doing this afternoon? It's my business. I was just thinking, because we found something interesting. What is it? That's our secret. We're behind the hill at the end of the beach. You can think again. It's really a great thing we've found there. George, come on! I don't understand you, Curtin, doing business with them again. Hello? Karner? Mr. Johnson, how nice to hear your voice again. I have the feeling that your work has entered an unpleasant phase, my dear sir. Bad luck for you. Oh, and one more thing. You will no longer receive Mr. Curtin on the frequency. Johnson, listen! We are well aware that you will be inconvenienced. First of all, we will have a thorough talk. I don't think anyone has been here for ages. You can't even see the end. You have to go a long way in here. Come on! This is not a cave. This is a tunnel that someone has built. It is incredibly long. He's probably going down to the sea. What is that? It's a dog. Hey, who are you? Who does it belong to? I don't know, maybe someone on the beach. Timmy! Timmy, where are you? That's George. I must be hearing something. So that's their great secret. Come on! Timmy, how many times have I told you not to chase rabbits? It doesn't feel dangerous when I tell you something. Would a good dog do that? You're a bad one. Come on now! Do I have to tell you everything a thousand times? Hello, George. Dick. So this is Timmy. How do you know his name? You just called him. He gave us a big fright. He's really sweet, George. Is he yours? Yes. And why haven't we seen him in the house yet? Father has forbidden me to keep him, but a boy in the village looks after him for me. I'd rather starve than give him away. And besides, I'm keeping him. him either. Oh, now I get it. So that's why you run away so much. But you don't need to be afraid. We won't tell you your secret. Absolutely not, George. Does he promise me that? Yes, we promise. You like us just as much as you do. Yes. Friends? Friends. I didn't like the fact that we were enemies anyway. What I wanted to tell you, George, is that the tunnel we found is not a normal tunnel. We didn't get very far, but we found some steps. Yes, they lead straight into the ground. And in the direction of Tumir. you're coming out with of course come on hello kids but it's now with my invitation we'd better go before he asks us what we're looking for down here yes I'm hungry anyway okay we're coming make yourselves comfortable then sit down guilty that's a bit messy Look at the telescope. Oh yes, that's my hobby. I watch birds. Karen Island. Oh, I can see Uncle Quentin's tower quite clearly. A kind of raven. Pyrocorax. Rare shorebirds. I've spotted a few of them on the island. Well, and of course I've seen you too. So, how's your father? My father? Oh yes. He's almost ready, he said. Oh, is that him? Yes. Good old Quentin. Er, well. Perhaps you could help me set the table. Some cake and biscuits. are in there I'm not doing the t up there now you'll find everything in the bottom compartment my boy excuse me oh my goodness the aunt I mean my aunt aunt john she's coming for tea have you forgotten you surely know her like that yes of course yes the days are really lovely unfortunately soon gone I'm sorry goodbye and thank you very much Well, but... It was really stupid of us. I'm sorry. Thank you anyway. Goodbye. Well, maybe another time. Who's Aunt Joan? We don't have an Aunt Joan at all. Of course not, but he said he knew her anyway. He's only pretending to be a friend of Father's. But I've never seen the guy before. You shouldn't have told him Father was nearly finished. You know it's a secret. I'm sorry, George. I didn't think of that. Don't you think you're exaggerating a bit, George? No, not at all. I think she's right. You probably didn't see what was in the closet. There was a radio, a pretty big one. Oh man! Really excellent, Kirk. Well, I'm sorry. You left so suddenly. I couldn't ask any questions. I heard everything I wanted to know. So Professor Kirin is, as the boy said, almost finished. Don't be so dogged, Kirk. You've got a lot to do tonight. Yes, maybe. But I still think we're worrying too much. As long as Uncle Quentin still signals on time. It's almost half past ten. Wow, that plane is flying low. It's flying over the island. Have you seen his signal yet, children? No, not yet. It should be coming any minute. Come on, father, go. Go! There! One, two, three. It's all right, George. Nothing's wrong. It's all right, Aunt Fanny. Good. Now off to bed with you. March, march. Phew, that's a relief. But first thing in the morning I'll look at the tower with binoculars. Good night. Good night. Night. Night. Professor Kirin, I presume. Who the hell are you? I don't think you know me. My name is Johnson. I'm from the Research Department. Thank God, Mr. Johnson. At first I thought you were some kind of... Or should I say, I was from the Research Department. Because recently... I have decided to open my own ministry. Do you understand? And this is the beginning, Professor. The best one I can think of. Here on Kirin Island. no danger. Trust in us, we'll get to work, who can resist us? Five friends, that's us. Julian, Dick and Ed, George and Tim, like the dog. Five friends, that's us. We'll come quickly, whenever you want us to. We're coming quickly And we're already here We're here"

Duas caveiras dormindo? Ganhei de novo, sem ressentimentos. Hein, Hugh? Vem jogar um pouquinho com a gente, s\u00f3 pra variar. N\u00e3o. Despe\u00e7o. N\u00e3o.  e saibam que na hora certa encontrar\u00e3o a salva\u00e7\u00e3o. Yagami, est\u00e1 prestando aten\u00e7\u00e3o? Pode, por favor, traduzir a frase seguinte? Sigam os ensinamentos de Deus e recebam as b\u00ean\u00e7\u00e3os. Assim ser\u00e1. E os mares voltar\u00e3o a ser abundantes e as tempestades furiosas se acalmar\u00e3o. Hoje, aproximadamente \u00e0s 11h da manh\u00e3, um homem de 32 anos,  foi encontrado morto apunhalado em seu apartamento na cidade de Yokohama, prov\u00edncia de Kanagawa. A pol\u00edcia de Kanagawa cuida desse homic\u00eddio. Nas not\u00edcias locais de hoje, o suspeito de assassinato, Naoki Kofuji, foi preso no distrito de Shibuya, T\u00f3quio. Ele est\u00e1 sob cust\u00f3dia acusado do brutal homic\u00eddio de sua companheira, que tinha apenas 25 anos quando foi morta. Entra dia, sai dia. As mesmas not\u00edcias se repetem.  Isso tudo \u00e9 t\u00e3o rid\u00edculo. Esse mundo est\u00e1 podre. Outra consequ\u00eancia \u00e9 a extin\u00e7\u00e3o de v\u00e1rias esp\u00e9cies do planeta. N\u00e3o acredito. Voc\u00ea pagou pra ver isso? Hoje em dia, o n\u00famero de esp\u00e9cies em extin\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 o maior j\u00e1 registrado.  I love you.  Death Note. Caderno da Morte. Modo de usar. O humano cujo nome for escrito nesse caderno morrer\u00e1. Isso \u00e9 rid\u00edculo. Sem falar que \u00e9 m\u00f3rbido. N\u00e3o \u00e9 muito diferente daquelas pir\u00e2mides que voc\u00ea recebe por e-mail. O humano cujo nome for escrito nesse caderno morrer\u00e1. N\u00e3o tem como.  Deve ter alguma coisa errada comigo para eu cogitar isso. Este caderno n\u00e3o surtir\u00e1 efeito a menos que se tenha em mente o rosto daquele cujo nome est\u00e1 sendo escrito. Portanto, outra pessoa com o mesmo nome n\u00e3o ser\u00e1 afetada. Se a causa da morte for escrita at\u00e9 40 segundos depois do nome da pessoa, segundo a unidade de tempo,  No tempo dos humanos, assim ser\u00e1 feito. Se a causa da morte n\u00e3o for especificada, a pessoa morrer\u00e1 de uma parada card\u00edaca. Ap\u00f3s a causa, os detalhes da morte devem ser fornecidos nos pr\u00f3ximos 6 minutos e 40 segundos. Ent\u00e3o, dependendo da pessoa que tem em mente, pode mat\u00e1-lo facilmente ou com dor. Isso \u00e9 detalhado demais para ser brincadeira. Ent\u00e3o, escreva o nome da pessoa...  E ela morre. Como se algu\u00e9m acreditasse nisso. Espera a\u00ed. Se algu\u00e9m morrer de verdade, isso me torna um assassino? T\u00e1 legal. Isso \u00e9 totalmente imposs\u00edvel.  O mesmo criminoso que atacou seis pessoas no shopping em Shijuku ontem atacou novamente, fazendo oito pessoas ref\u00e9ns numa creche. Os ref\u00e9ns incluem crian\u00e7as e monitores. A pol\u00edcia identificou o suspeito como sendo Kuro Otoharada, de 42 anos, atualmente desempregado. Esperamos que as negocia\u00e7\u00f5es se iniciem logo. Uma parada card\u00edaca em 40 segundos. Vamos ver. Nesse momento \u00e9 s\u00f3 o que a pol\u00edcia revela.  Estamos todos preocupados com a seguran\u00e7a desses ref\u00e9ns. Voc\u00ea tem raz\u00e3o. Vamos continuar a monitorar a situa\u00e7\u00e3o aqui. Obrigada pelas not\u00edcias. O que acha disso, Sr. Hashimoto? Bom, s\u00f3 podemos esperar uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o r\u00e1pida para essa situa\u00e7\u00e3o. Parece que o caderno n\u00e3o funciona. Bom, eu n\u00e3o esperava que funcionasse. Espera, estamos vendo alguma coisa. Parece que tem movimento na porta da frente. Os ref\u00e9ns est\u00e3o saindo e eles parecem ilesos.  As for\u00e7as especiais est\u00e3o em a\u00e7\u00e3o. Eles v\u00e3o entrar. N\u00e3o sabemos se o suspeito foi preso. Sim. T\u00e1, agora temos confirma\u00e7\u00e3o. O suspeito foi encontrado morto l\u00e1 dentro. Repito, o suspeito est\u00e1 morto. Morto? As for\u00e7as especiais negam as alega\u00e7\u00f5es e atiraram no suspeito. Ent\u00e3o o senhor acha que ele ficou acuado e cometeu o suic\u00eddio? Bom, de acordo com os ref\u00e9ns, o suspeito teve um ataque fulminante. Uma coisa card\u00edaca.  Eu n\u00e3o acredito. \u00c9 coincid\u00eancia. S\u00f3 pode ser coincid\u00eancia. Light! J\u00e1 s\u00e3o seis e meia, sabia? Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o tem curso hoje \u00e0 noite? Tenho. J\u00e1 j\u00e1 eu t\u00f4 pronto. Death Note. \u00c9 improv\u00e1vel, mas se essa coisa for real... Eu tenho que testar mais uma vez. E nesse caso, \u00e9 melhor ser mais um criminoso. Mas se ele for muito conhecido...  Eu vou ter problemas. Se ele morrer, tem uma boa possibilidade da not\u00edcia sobre a morte dele ser acobertada. E eu tenho que ver os resultados logo. Hi-oh! Amigo! O que foi, Sudo? Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o disse que me emprestaria 2 mil ienes? O qu\u00ea? De novo? Eu n\u00e3o posso fazer isso! Sudo, acho que eu devia tentar matar esse cara. N\u00e3o. \u00c9 melhor evitar matar pessoas que eu conhe\u00e7o. U\u00e9, mas ser\u00e1 que isso importa mesmo? Algu\u00e9m se importaria se um cara como voc\u00ea  como ele desaparecesse algum dia? Maneiro! Acho que a gente vai passar no shopping depois da escola. Olha, n\u00f3s vamos ter uma festa de solteiros amanh\u00e3. Voc\u00ea quer vir? \u00c9 claro! Ah, eu n\u00e3o vou perder por nada. Droga, por que minha m\u00e3e \u00e9 t\u00e3o in\u00fatil? Ela nunca vem me buscar na hora. Quando voc\u00ea come\u00e7a a olhar em volta, se pergunta se faria um favor \u00e0 sociedade se livrando de todas essas pessoas. Ah, oi!  Ei, gatinha, onde voc\u00ea vai? Vem se divertir com a gente. Esse Otaku acha uma gostosa a quil\u00f4metros de dist\u00e2ncia. E a\u00ed, gatinha, eu sou Otaku Shibuimaru. O que voc\u00ea acha? Vem ficar com a gente, gatinha. Por favor, eu n\u00e3o quero problema. E ouviu s\u00f3? N\u00e3o quer problema. N\u00e3o \u00e9 bonitinho? Vamos, pessoal. Tirem logo a roupa lenta. \u00c9? Tem certeza? N\u00e3o!  Pare! Ih! Vov\u00f3! Vov\u00f3! Aaaaaah! E agora? O que ser\u00e1 que vai acontecer? Espera! Volta! Corpo n\u00e3o! \u00c9 isso. O Death Note... \u00c9 real. Ah, n\u00e3o!  Taku! Garoto idiota, ele saiu do nada. Sabe, \u00e9 melhor eu ir andando. Faz cinco dias. Ent\u00e3o, \u00e9 melhor eu ir andando.  Vai para algum lugar, Luke? Lamento, mas nosso mundo todo \u00e9 assim. \u00c9 verdade, mas eu perdi o meu Death Note. Fez besteira, n\u00e3o foi? D\u00e1 um tempo. Voc\u00ea j\u00e1 n\u00e3o cantou o velho para ter um segundo livro? N\u00e3o me diz que perdeu os dois. Voc\u00ea deve ter alguma ideia de onde deixou essa coisa. Tenho. No mundo dos humanos. O qu\u00ea?  A CIDADE NO BRASIL Que surpresa boa. N\u00e3o esperava voc\u00ea em casa t\u00e3o cedo. Sim.  Oi, m\u00e3e. \u00c9 porque... Ah, t\u00e1. O resultado das provas, n\u00e9? Estou esperando o dia todo. T\u00e1 aqui. Parab\u00e9ns! O primeiro de novo. \u00c9 a maior pontua\u00e7\u00e3o que j\u00e1 teve. \u00c9, eu acho, n\u00e9? Vou estudar no quarto. N\u00e3o me interrompe, n\u00e3o, t\u00e1? Por favor. Voc\u00ea quem sabe. Ah, Light, voc\u00ea quer alguma coisa, querido? Pode pedir o que quiser. N\u00e3o, t\u00e1 tudo bem, m\u00e3e. Obrigado.  Eu j\u00e1 tenho o que eu quero. Vejo que pegou gosto pela coisa.  Por que ficou t\u00e3o surpreso? Eu sou o Shinigami Ryuki. Esse caderno era meu. A julgar pela sua risada, voc\u00ea j\u00e1 descobriu que o que tem na m\u00e3o n\u00e3o \u00e9 um caderno comum. Shinigami. Um deus da morte. N\u00e3o estou surpreso. Na verdade...  Eu estava te esperando, Ryuki. Ah. Eu j\u00e1 descobri que esse caderno \u00e9 real. E nem demorei muito. E agora que testemunhei a prova do seu poder, eu s\u00f3 me sinto mais confiante no que vou fazer. Que interessante. Eu n\u00e3o estava esperando isso. V\u00e1rios Death Notes chegaram ao mundo humano no passado. Mas voc\u00ea \u00e9 o primeiro a escrever tantos nomes. Olha quantos.  Quantas pessoas voc\u00ea matou em apenas cinco dias? A maioria ficaria relutante em escrever tanto. Eu j\u00e1 me preparei, Ryuki. Usei o caderno mesmo sabendo que ele pertencia a um Shinigami. E agora que esse Shinigami chegou, o que vai acontecer comigo? Vai levar a minha alma? Como assim? Isso \u00e9 alguma fantasia que voc\u00eas humanos inventaram? Eu n\u00e3o vou fazer nada com voc\u00ea. O caderno se torna parte do mundo dos humanos.  no momento em que ele toca a terra. Em outras palavras, o caderno agora \u00e9 seu. Ele \u00e9 meu? Se n\u00e3o quiser, \u00e9 s\u00f3 dar a outra pessoa. Mas se der, eu serei obrigado a apagar suas lembran\u00e7as do caderno. Ent\u00e3o est\u00e1 dizendo que eu posso usar o Death Note o quanto quiser e n\u00e3o vou ser punido? Digamos assim, voc\u00ea vai sentir o medo e a dor que s\u00f3 os humanos que usaram o caderno conhecem. E quando for sua vez de morte...  Ele vir\u00e1 para mim para que eu escreva seu nome no meu Death Note. Saiba que nenhum humano que usou o Death Note... pode ir para o c\u00e9u ou para o inferno pela eternidade. S\u00f3 isso. Agora voc\u00ea tem o que esperar depois da morte. Light? N\u00e3o tem problema. Pode abrir.  O que foi? Achei que gostaria das ma\u00e7\u00e3s que os vizinhos trouxeram. Por que est\u00e1 t\u00e3o escuro no seu quarto? Vai acabar com a sua vista. O que est\u00e1 acontecendo? Minha m\u00e3e n\u00e3o consegue v\u00ea-lo? Aquele caderno que voc\u00ea encontrou pertencia a mim. E j\u00e1 que voc\u00ea est\u00e1 usando ele agora, voc\u00ea \u00e9 o \u00fanico que pode me ver. E claro, minha voz s\u00f3 pode ser ouvida por voc\u00ea. Em outras palavras, o Death Note \u00e9 ligado a voc\u00ea.  entre Light, o humano, e Ryuk, o Shinigami. Delicioso. S\u00f3 tenho mais uma pergunta pra fazer. Por que eu fui escolhido pra isso? Oh, voc\u00ea t\u00e1 me ouvindo? As ma\u00e7\u00e3s no mundo dos humanos valem a viagem. Qual \u00e9 a melhor maneira de descrever isso? Suculenta? Responda a minha pergunta. Eu n\u00e3o escolhi voc\u00ea. Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o veio.  Isso foi um acidente. Voc\u00ea achou mesmo que tinha sido escolhido porque \u00e9 muito inteligente? N\u00e3o seja t\u00e3o vaidoso. Ele caiu aqui por acaso, e por acaso voc\u00ea pegou. \u00c9 s\u00f3 isso. Por isso que escrevi as instru\u00e7\u00f5es em ingl\u00eas, a l\u00edngua mais popular no mundo humano. Ent\u00e3o por que voc\u00ea largou o caderno? Escreveu at\u00e9 as instru\u00e7\u00f5es espec\u00edficas. Ent\u00e3o n\u00e3o venha me dizer que isso foi um acidente. Est\u00e1 me perguntando por qu\u00ea? Fez isso porque estava impediado.  Entendiado. O Shinigami n\u00e3o tem muito o que fazer hoje em dia. A maior parte do tempo, ou cochilamos ou jogamos. Se voc\u00ea aproveita o tempo para escrever nomes em seu Death Note, os outros riem de voc\u00ea por trabalhar muito. Se escrever o nome de outro Shinigami, n\u00e3o adianta porque eles n\u00e3o morrem. E j\u00e1 que vivemos num mundo dos Shinigamis, tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada divertido matar no mundo dos humanos. Ent\u00e3o, achei que seria mais divertido se eu viesse aqui e pensasse...  Pessoalmente. Estou surpreso com tantos nomes que voc\u00ea escreveu. Mas quero saber por que voc\u00ea escreveu a causa da morte s\u00f3 daquele cara que foi atingido pelo caminh\u00e3o. Se n\u00e3o escrever a causa da morte, a v\u00edtima morre de parada card\u00edaca. E essa deve ser a melhor coisa do Death Note, Ryuki. \u00c9? Sabia que eu j\u00e1 pesquisei a lista dos maiores criminosos do mundo? E um dia eu vou me livrar de todos eles. E qual o sentido de fazer isso? \u00c9 quest\u00e3o de tempo at\u00e9 descobrirem que esse...  Estes criminosos est\u00e3o sendo eliminados por algu\u00e9m. Quero que o mundo saiba da minha exist\u00eancia. Que saiba que existe algu\u00e9m por a\u00ed julgando os maldosos. Por que se preocupa? O que quer ganhar julgando todos eles? Por que voc\u00ea se importa? Porque eu tamb\u00e9m estava entediado. Eu n\u00e3o estava pronto para acreditar. Mas agora \u00e9 \u00f3bvio. Tem alguma coisa no Death Note?  que faz os humanos quererem experimentar pelo menos uma vez. Eu matei os dois. Eu matei dois homens. Aquelas eram vidas humanas. Isso n\u00e3o vai ser esquecido. Al\u00e9m do mais, quem sou eu para julgar as pessoas? N\u00e3o. N\u00e3o. Talvez eu esteja errado. Era exatamente nisso que eu estava pensando. Esse mundo est\u00e1 podre. E aqueles que fazem isso...  apodrecer merecem morrer. Algu\u00e9m tem que fazer isso. Ent\u00e3o por que n\u00e3o eu? Mesmo se for preciso sacrificar minha mente e minha alma, vale a pena, porque o mundo n\u00e3o pode continuar assim. O que aconteceria se outra pessoa pegasse esse caderno? Tem mais algu\u00e9m por a\u00ed, al\u00e9m de mim, que queira eliminar os vermes do mundo? Se eu n\u00e3o fizer isso, quem vai fazer? Ent\u00e3o n\u00e3o tem mais ningu\u00e9m. Mas eu posso fazer. Na verdade, eu sou um  \u00fanico que pode eu vou fazer isso usando def note eu vou mudar o mundo  Primeiro escrevi os nomes dos piores criminosos que eu pude lembrar, como se limpasse o mundo um nome de cada vez. Para que um dia ningu\u00e9m fa\u00e7a nada mais de mal. Enquanto os verdadeiramente culpados que merecem ser punidos por seus crimes morrem de parada card\u00edaca, a gente vai ver.  As pessoas menos culpadas, mas que ainda causam problemas, ser\u00e3o gradualmente apagadas por doen\u00e7a ou morte acidental. Ent\u00e3o, e s\u00f3 ent\u00e3o, o mundo vai come\u00e7ar a se mover na dire\u00e7\u00e3o certa. Ser\u00e1 um novo mundo, livre de injusti\u00e7a e populado por pessoas que eu julguei serem honestas, gentis e trabalhadoras. Mas se fizer isso, voc\u00ea vai ser a \u00fanica pessoa m\u00e1 no mundo. H\u00e3? N\u00e3o fa\u00e7o a m\u00ednima ideia do que est\u00e1 falando. Eu sou um grande aluno esfor\u00e7ado, que \u00e9 considerado um dos melhores e mais brilhantes do Jap\u00e3o.  E eu? Eu vou me tornar o deus desse novo mundo. Foi o que imaginei. Os humanos s\u00e3o t\u00e3o interessantes. \u3054\u8996\u8074\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f \u304a\u75b2\u308c\u69d8\u3067\u3057\u305f  Eu vou mostrar ao mundo o que acontece quando tentam me contrariar O mundo inteiro est\u00e1 observando agora L",
        "translated": "In the spreading darkness, we exchanged vows of revolution. We can't let anyone get in our way. So the quest tells us sameme ...  \u00a9 BF-WATCH TV 2021 What? Two sleeping skulls? I win again, no hard feelings. Hey, Hugh? Come play with us for a little while, just for a change. No. I'm dismissed. No. and know that at the right time you will find salvation. Yagami, are you paying attention? Can you please translate the following sentence? Follow God's teachings and receive the blessings. So it will be. And the seas will once again be abundant and the raging storms will calm down. Today, at approximately 11:00 a.m., a 32-year-old man, was found stabbed to death in his apartment in Yokohama City, Kanagawa Prefecture. The Kanagawa Police are handling this homicide. In today's local news, murder suspect Naoki Kofuji was arrested in Shibuya Ward, Tokyo. He is in custody accused of the brutal murder of his partner, who was just 25 years old when she was killed. Day in, day out. The same news repeats itself. This is all so ridiculous. This world is rotten. Another consequence is the extinction of several species on the planet. I can't believe it. Did you pay to see this? Today, the number of species facing extinction is the highest ever recorded. I love you. Death Note. How to use it. The human whose name is written in this notebook will die. This is ridiculous. Not to mention morbid. It's not much different from those pyramids you receive in your email. The human whose name is written in this notebook will die. There's no way. There must be something wrong with me for me to think this. This notebook will have no effect unless the face of the person whose name is being written is in mind. Therefore, another person with the same name will not be affected. If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of the person's name, according to the unit of time, In human time, this is how it will be done. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will die of cardiac arrest. After the cause, the details of the death must be given within the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds. Then, depending on the person you have in mind, you can kill them easily or painfully. This is too detailed to be a joke. So, write down the person's name... And she dies. As if anyone would believe that. Wait a minute. If someone actually dies, does that make me a murderer? Okay. That's totally impossible. The same criminal who attacked six people at a shopping mall in Shijuku yesterday has struck again, taking eight people hostage at a daycare center. The hostages include children and caretakers. Police have identified the suspect as Kuro Otoharada, 42, who is currently unemployed. We hope negotiations begin soon. Cardiac arrest in 40 seconds. Let's see. At this point, that's all the police have to say. We are all concerned about the safety of these hostages. You are right. We will continue to monitor the situation here. Thank you for the update. What do you think of this, Mr. Hashimoto? Well, we can only hope for a quick resolution to this situation. It seems that the notebook does not work. Well, I did not expect it to work. Wait, we are seeing something. It seems that there is movement at the front door. The hostages are coming out, and they appear unharmed. The special forces are in action. They're going in. We don't know if the suspect has been arrested. Yes. Okay, now we have confirmation. The suspect was found dead inside. I repeat, the suspect is dead. Dead? The special forces deny the allegations and shot the suspect. So you think he was cornered and committed suicide? Well, according to the hostages, the suspect had a massive attack. A heart problem. I don't believe it. It's a coincidence. It can only be a coincidence. Light! It's already six thirty, you know? Don't you have a class tonight? I do. I'll be ready soon. Death Note. It's unlikely, but if this thing is real... I have to test it one more time. And in that case, it's better to be another criminal. But if he's very well-known... I'm going to be in trouble. If he dies, there's a good chance that the news about his death will be covered up. And I have to see the results soon. Hi-oh! Buddy! What's up, Sudo? Didn't you say you'd lend me 2,000 yen? What? Again? I can't do this! Sudo, I think I should try to kill this guy. No. It's better to avoid killing people I know. Hey, but does it really matter? Would anyone care if a guy like you like he just disappeared one day? Cool! I think we're going to stop by the mall after school. Hey, we're having a bachelor's party tomorrow. Do you want to come? Of course! Oh, I wouldn't miss it for anything. Damn, why is my mom so useless? She never picks me up on time. When you start looking around, you wonder if you'd be doing society a favor by getting rid of all these people. Oh, hi! Hey, kitty, where are you going? Come have some fun with us. This Otaku finds a hottie miles away. Hey, kitty, I'm Otaku Shibuimaru. What do you think? Come hang out with us, kitty. Please, I don't want any trouble. And did you hear that? You don't want any trouble. Isn't that cute? Come on, guys. Take off your clothes, slow. Really? Are you sure? No! Stop! Oh! Grandma! Grandma! Aaaaaah! What now? What do you think will happen? Wait! Come back! Not the body! That's it. The Death Note... It's real. Oh, no! Taku! Stupid boy, he came out of nowhere. You know, I better get going. It's been five days. So, I better get going. Are you going somewhere, Luke? I'm sorry, but our whole world is like that. It's true, but I lost my Death Note. You messed up, didn't you? Give me a break. Didn't you already sing the old man to get a second book? Don't tell me you lost both. You must have some idea where you left that thing. I do. In the human world. What? THE CITY IN BRAZIL What a nice surprise. I didn't expect you home so soon. Yes. Hi, Mom. It's because... Oh, okay. The test results, right? I've been waiting all day. Here they are. Congratulations! First again. That's the highest score you've ever had. Yeah, I think, right? I'm going to study in my room. Don't interrupt me, okay? Please. It's up to you. Oh, Light, do you want anything, dear? You can ask for whatever you want. No, it's okay, Mom. Thank you. I already have what I want. I see you've developed a taste for it. Why are you so surprised? I am the Shinigami Ryuki. This notebook was mine. Judging by your laughter, you've already figured out that what you're holding in your hand is no ordinary notebook. Shinigami. A god of death. I'm not surprised. In fact... I've been waiting for you, Ryuki. Ah. I've already discovered that this notebook is real. And it didn't take me long. And now that I've witnessed proof of your power, I only feel more confident in what I'm going to do. How interesting. I wasn't expecting this. Several Death Notes have reached the human world in the past. But you're the first to write down so many names. Look how many. How many people have you killed in just five days? Most people would be reluctant to write so much. I've already prepared myself, Ryuki. I used the notebook even though I knew it belonged to a Shinigami. And now that this Shinigami has arrived, what will happen to me? Will he take my soul? What do you mean? Is this some fantasy you humans have made up? I won't do anything to you. The notebook becomes part of the human world. the moment it touches the ground. In other words, the notebook is now yours. Is it mine? If you don't want it, just give it to someone else. But if you do, I will be forced to erase your memories from the notebook. So you're saying that I can use the Death Note as much as I want and I won't be punished? Let's put it this way, you will feel the fear and pain that only humans who have used the notebook know. And when it's your turn to die... He will come to me so that I may write his name in my Death Note. Know that no human who has used the Death Note... can go to heaven or hell for eternity. That's all. Now you have what to look forward to after death. Light? No problem. You can open it. What's wrong? I thought you'd like the apples the neighbors brought. Why is it so dark in your room? It's going to ruin your eyesight. What's going on? Can't my mom see you? That notebook you found belonged to me. And since you're using it right now, you're the only one who can see me. And of course, my voice can only be heard by you. In other words, the Death Note is tied to you. between Light, the human, and Ryuk, the Shinigami. Delicious. I just have one more question to ask. Why was I chosen for this? Oh, are you listening to me? The apples in the human world are worth the trip. What's the best way to describe it? Juicy? Answer my question. I didn't choose you. You didn't come. This was an accident. Did you really think you were chosen because you are so smart? Don't be so conceited. It fell here by chance, and you picked it up by chance. That's all. That's why I wrote the instructions in English, the most popular language in the human world. So why did you put the notebook down? You even wrote down the specific instructions. So don't tell me this was an accident. Are you asking me why? You did it because you were prevented. Bored. Shinigami don't have much to do these days. Most of the time, we either nap or play games. If you take the time to write names in your Death Note, the others laugh at you for working too hard. If you write the name of another Shinigami, it's no use because they don't die. And since we live in a Shinigami world, it's no fun to kill in the human world either. So, I thought it would be more fun if I came here and thought... Personally, I'm surprised at how many names you wrote. But I want to know why you wrote the cause of death only for the guy who got hit by the truck. If you don't write the cause of death, the victim dies of cardiac arrest. And that must be the best thing about Death Note, Ryuki. Really? Did you know that I've already researched the list of the world's greatest criminals? And one day I'm going to get rid of them all. And what's the point of doing that? It's only a matter of time before they find out that this... These criminals are being eliminated by someone. I want the world to know I exist. To know that there is someone out there judging the evil ones. Why do you care? What do you want to gain by judging all of them? Why do you care? Because I was bored too. I wasn't ready to believe it. But now it's obvious. Is there something in the Death Note? that makes humans want to try it at least once. I killed them both. I killed two men. Those were human lives. That will not be forgotten. Besides, who am I to judge people? No. No. Maybe I'm wrong. That's exactly what I was thinking. This world is rotten. And those who do this... rot deserve to die. Someone has to do it. So why not me? Even if it means sacrificing my mind and soul, it's worth it, because the world can't go on like this. What would happen if someone else picked up this notebook? Is there anyone else out there besides me who wants to eliminate the vermin from the world? If I don't do it, who will? Well, there's no one else. But I can do it. In fact, I am a only one who can i will do it using def note i will change the world First I wrote down the names of the worst criminals I could think of, as if I were cleaning the world one name at a time. So that one day no one would do anything bad anymore. While the truly guilty who deserve to be punished for their crimes die of cardiac arrest, we'll see. The people who are less guilty but still cause trouble will gradually be eliminated by illness or accidental death. Then, and only then, will the world begin to move in the right direction. It will be a new world, free from injustice and populated by people I have judged to be honest, kind, and hard-working. But if you do that, you will be the only bad person in the world. Huh? I have no idea what you are talking about. I am a great, hard-working student who is considered one of the best and brightest in Japan. And me? I'm going to become the god of this new world. That's what I imagined. Humans are so interesting. Thank you for watching thank you for your hard work I'm gonna show the world what happens when they try to cross me The whole world is watching now L"

Wo immer ein R\u00e4tsel zu l\u00f6sen ist, hoch in dem alten Schloss oder im Schwung, ja, Mest, f\u00fcnf Freunde, das sind wir. Julian, Dick und M, George und Tim, wie der Hund.  Und f\u00fcnf Freunde, das sind wir. Wir kommen schnell herbei, wann immer wir es wollen. Und schon sind wir da.  Na, wie weit sind Sie, Mr. Rogers? Gleich fertig, Mrs. Kirill. Gut. George! George! George! George, mach dich doch bitte schon mal fertig. Und vielleicht r\u00e4umst du auch dein Zimmer auf, Sie m\u00fcssen jeden Tag...  Ich will jeden Moment hier sein. Wie weit ist es noch, Julia? Vielleicht noch eine Meile. Vom Bahnhof aus sind wir ungef\u00e4hr f\u00fcnf Meilen gefahren. Ist ja nicht zu glauben. Endlich geht es mal bergab. Ist ja irre sch\u00f6n hier, was? Ja, ja, eine tolle Luft. Oh, guck doch mal das Meer. Das da dr\u00fcben ist bestimmt Cairn Island. Ja, m\u00fcsste es eigentlich. Was ist denn das f\u00fcr ein komischer Turm? Keine Ahnung.  Aber Ginny wei\u00df das bestimmt. Los, wir wollen wenigstens p\u00fcnktlich sein. George! Georgina! Also wirklich Georgina. Georgina! Komm her!  Das muss es sein. Los! Los! Entschuldigen Sie bitte. Ist das die Karen Cottage? Wieso willst du das wissen? Wir sind Verwandte von Georgina. Wie?  Ihre Mutter hat uns eingeladen. So eine lause Bande hat Professor Kirin noch gefehlt. Und drei mehr, die herumwimmeln, L\u00e4rm machen und ihn bei der Arbeit st\u00f6ren. Er hat verdammtes Gl\u00fcck, dass er meistens auf der Insel ist. Dann hat er wohl diesen komischen Turm gebaut. Ja, hat was mit seinem Experiment zu tun. Ist aber streng geheim, klar? Also seht euch vor und plaudert nicht mit fremden Leuten dar\u00fcber. Und lasst euch ja nicht in einem meiner Gem\u00fcsebeete erwischen.  Ach, da seid ihr ja. Ist aber sch\u00f6n, euch mal wiederzusehen. Tag, Tante Fanny. Ihr seid vielleicht gewachsen, seit ich euch das letzte Mal gesehen habe. Anne war damals noch ein Baby. Wartet mal, du m\u00fcsstest Julian sein und das ist Dick. Na, wie war die Reise? Einfach klasse, Tante Fanny. Die Fahrt vom Bahnhof hierher war doch prima. Ja, na gut. Ich habe beim Bahnhof angerufen, euer Gep\u00e4ck wird hergebracht. Stellt die Fahrr\u00e4der hinters Haus, gleich gibt's Tee. Ihr habt doch bestimmt auch Hunger.  Und Sie, stell dir vor, die beiden w\u00e4ren beinahe vom Rad gefallen. Besonders Andy war so schwach, dass er sich immer den Kopf gehalten hat. Der fehlt irgendwie Vitamine. Immer muss diese bl\u00f6de Witze machen. Ja, ja, eure Mutter hat mir schon gesagt, dass ihr solche Scherze treibt. Dann l\u00e4sst man jetzt gar nicht hin, dann wird das ein Selbstmord. Wunderbarer Nachmittag, Herr Johnson. Wunderbarer Nachmittag. Ja, muss ich auch sagen, Mr. Johnson. Ich hoffe, Sie haben gut gespeist. Passabel. Es wurde nur ein bisschen zu viel geredet.  Es wird Zeit f\u00fcr eine sch\u00f6ne Tasse B\u00fcrotee. Oh ja. Ja. \u00c4h, Miss Peters, ich muss unvorhergesehenerweise f\u00fcr ein paar Tage wegfahren.  Ich bin sicher, der Minister wird bis zu meiner R\u00fcckkehr auch ohne mich auskommen. Lassen Sie bitte den Wagen vorfahren, Miss Peters. Ja, Mr. Johnson. Dankesch\u00f6n. Ich habe mir gedacht, morgen fahren wir alle auf die Insel und essen zu Mittag mit Onkel Quentin. Klasse! Wo ist denn Georgina, Tante Fanny? Wir haben uns schon so auf sie gefreut. Wei\u00df auch nicht, wo sie ist.  sie ist. Also George verschwindet immer gerade dann, wenn sie es nicht soll. Aber wieso nennst du sie George? Sie will es so. Aber jeder denkt dann, sie ist ein Junge und kein M\u00e4dchen. Anscheinend will sie es nicht anders. Also ich m\u00f6chte nicht, dass man denkt, ich w\u00e4re ein Junge. Nein, nat\u00fcrlich nicht. Aber du bist ja auch nicht wie George. Ach, dass du dich auch mal sehen l\u00e4sst. Wir haben fast alles aufgegessen. Ich habe keinen Hunger. Danke, Mutter. Willst du nicht guten Tag sagen? Das sind Annie, Dick und Julian. Hallo. Tag.  Hallo. Hallo. Warum gehst du nicht mit ihm raus, George, und zeigst ihm ein bisschen die Gegend? Aber ich muss doch noch... Ja, was? Was musst du? Nichts. Dann ist's ja gut. Also ab mit euch. Ich r\u00e4um den Tisch ab. Danke f\u00fcr den Tee, Tante Fanny. Der Honig war auch ganz gut. Viel Spa\u00df, Kinder. H\u00f6rt mal. Kommt nicht zu sp\u00e4t zur\u00fcck. Nein, nein.  Tante Fanny hat gesagt, wir wurden morgen auf Onkel Quentys Insel fahren. Findest du das nicht klasse, Georgina? Mein Name ist nicht Georgina, ich hei\u00dfe George. Und die Insel geh\u00f6rt nicht ihm, sondern mir. Was regst du dich denn gleich auf? Sie geh\u00f6rt mir. Er hat sie mir geschenkt. Und jetzt arbeitet er da und l\u00e4sst mich \u00fcberhaupt nicht mehr hin. Aber wenn seine Arbeit ein so gro\u00dfes Geheimnis ist, warum macht er sie dann an einem Ort, wo jeder hinkommen kann, wenn er will? Du kannst es ja mal versuchen.  und die Klippen vor der Insel machen aus deinem Boot Kleinholz. Nur Vater und ich wissen, wie man da durchkommt. Er ist dort, weil er dicke Zeiten f\u00fcr seine Experimente braucht. Deshalb ist er auf meiner Insel. Also das f\u00e4nde ich auch prima, in einer eigenen Insel zu arbeiten. H\u00f6rt mal, ich habe jetzt was zu erledigen. Das geht nur mich was an, verstanden? Also kommt mir blo\u00df nicht hinterhergeschlichen, keiner von euch. Wir haben was Besseres zu tun. Das kann ja lustig werden mit dir. Na, f\u00fcr euch ist es ja nicht weiter schlimm, aber ich muss mit dir in einem Zimmer schlafen. Ich sage euch, das werden bestimmt zwei verdammt lange Wochen dauern.  Kochen wir uns. Darf ich Ihnen noch eins bringen? Warum nicht, wenn Sie es bezahlen, gerne. Oh, das w\u00e4re mir ein Vergn\u00fcgen. Bitte? Danke. Timmy! Timmy! Oh, komm Timmy, komm! Na los, komm!  Na komm, mein Kleiner. Och, Timmy. Das ist die Kleine von Quentin Curran, nicht wahr? Ja. Die ist wilder als ein Junge. Und die meisten hier sagen nur George zu ihr. Zum Wohl. Zum Wohl. Und das da ist ihr Hund. Der Professor.  wollte den Hund nicht im Haus haben. Sie sollte ihn weggeben, aber an dem K\u00f6ter h\u00e4ngt sie mehr als an allem anderen. Sagen Sie, wo ist Quentin jetzt? Ich habe ihn lange nicht mehr gesehen. Er hat sich fast v\u00f6llig auf die Insel zur\u00fcckgezogen, experimentiert. Er kommt \u00fcberhaupt nicht mehr r\u00fcber. Seine Frau bringt alles, was er braucht, zur Insel r\u00fcber. Vorher muss sie aber immer erst signalisieren, dass alles in Ordnung ist. Dann blinkt er dreimal vom Turm mit einer Taschenlampe. Jeden Morgen und jeden Abend um elf, danach k\u00f6nnen sie ihre Uhr stellen. Jeder hat seine Marotten. Ist das nicht verr\u00fcckt, so viel zu arbeiten?  Los, komm, hier gef\u00e4llt's mir. Wenn sich Georgina nur nicht so furchtbar bl\u00f6d benehmen w\u00fcrde. Sag blo\u00df George zu ihr. Wer zuletzt oben ist, muss morgen das Eis bezahlen. Das sagst du nur, weil ich sowieso verliere.  Sieht hier aber sehr einsam aus. Hey, seht mal. Sieht aus, als w\u00e4re das eine gro\u00dfe H\u00f6hle. Kommt mal her. Da kann man nicht viel sehen. Kommt, wir gehen mal tiefer rein. Wir k\u00f6nnen doch nicht ohne Taschenlampe reingehen. Gut, dann gehen wir eben zur\u00fcck und holen uns eine. Daf\u00fcr reicht die Zeit nicht. Wisst ihr was, wir kommen morgen nochmal her und untersuchen sie.  dann? Klar, die l\u00e4uft uns ja nicht weg. Wartet mal. Wir behalten das aber f\u00fcr uns, ja? George hat ihr Geheimnis und diese H\u00f6hle ist nun unser Geheimnis, okay? Okay. Oh, hallo Kinder. Ihr seid doch zu Besuch auf Kirin Cottage, nicht wahr? Ja, das stimmt. Ist George nicht mitgekommen? Nein.  Euer Onkel und eure Tante sind gute Freunde von mir. Wollt ihr morgen nicht bei mir Tee trinken? Naja, ich wei\u00df noch nicht, was wir morgen... Naja, ist ja egal. Kommt, wenn ihr Lust habt. Ich w\u00fcrde mich freuen. Auf Wiedersehen. Komischer Kauz. Das Wimmelchen nur so von merkw\u00fcrdigen Leuten. Tante Fanny ist der einzig normale Mensch, der mir hier bisher begegnet ist. Onkel Quentin scheint ja wohl auch ein bisschen komisch zu sein.  Wenn wir morgen feststellen, wenn wir r\u00fcberfahren auf die Insel, nicht wahr? Darf ich rudern, George? Nein, die Klippen sind zu gef\u00e4hrlich, aber ablegen darfst du.  Da sitzen Kinder. Vater! Vater! Ist er immer in seinem Turm, Tante Penny? Nein, wenn wir ihn rufen, kommt er meistens sofort.  George, nimm die Jungs mit und seht, ob ihr ihn findet. Okay, komm. Ich freu mich schon aufs Essen. Vater! Vater! Mann, sowas hab ich ja noch nie gesehen. Seht euch das an! Sag mal, George, wei\u00dft du, was das f\u00fcr Dinger sind da oben am Turm? Ich k\u00f6nnte mir vorstellen, dass das irgendwas mit Sonnenenergie zu tun hat. Die Reflektoren oder wie das hei\u00dft, stehen vielleicht woanders.  Vater! Vater! Er ist wohl nicht da oben. Irgendwo muss er doch sein. Hier bin ich!  Professor Curran. Ihre Insel scheint ja ziemliche Aufmerksamkeit zu erringen.  Du bist gewachsen seit dem letzten Mal. Das war vor acht Jahren, Onkel Quentin. Ach wirklich? Dann war es ja wohl zu erwarten, oder was meint ihr? Wo treibst du dich denn im Moment auf der Insel rum? In den Kellern. In den Kellern? Unter den Ruinen, die Keller vom alten Schloss. Sag mal, ist das dein Geheimlabor? Ja, ja, wenn man will, kann man es.  zu nennen k\u00fcmmert sich georgia anst\u00e4ndig um euch sie hat uns raus gerudert um die gef\u00e4hrlichen klippen rum alle achtung die kann rudern besser als ein junge wei\u00df so jetzt muss ich erst mal zur\u00fcck ich habe da noch was zu kontrollieren danke f\u00fcr den nachschub george du kannst deine insel bald zur\u00fcck haben ich bin so gut wie fertig und vergisst die signale nicht ich mache mir sonst noch nicht denkt dran  Am\u00fcsiert euch noch gut. Also dann, Wiedersehen. Wiedersehen. Sieh da, sieh da. Eine reizende \u00dcberraschung, Sie wiederzusehen, Curtin. Johnson. Ich nehme an, Sie beobachten seltene Wasserv\u00f6gel, nicht wahr? Was f\u00fcr ein hervorragendes Teleskop. Ja, das ist der...  ein ausgezeichnetes Fernrohr. Ach, sagen Sie mir, f\u00fcr wen arbeiten Sie denn diesmal? Russland, China, Amerika? Damals, als wir uns das letzte Mal begegneten, waren Sie f\u00fcr uns sehr unbequem, K\u00f6rten. Ich hoffe, dass Sie sich dar\u00fcber klar sind. H\u00f6ren Sie, ich arbeite f\u00fcr niemanden. Ich gebe Ihnen mein Wort. Ihr Wort. Ach, wenn das kein Funkger\u00e4t ist, will ich sofort tot umfallen. So, das reicht. Vielen Dank.  Schickt eure Schwimmwesten rein, ja? So, und du tr\u00e4gst das. So, komm Kinder. George, was machst du denn heute Nachmittag? Das ist ja wohl meine Sache. Ich habe nur gedacht, weil wir etwas Interessantes gefunden haben. Was denn? Das ist unser Geheimnis. Wir sind hinter dem H\u00fcgel am Ende vom Strand. Du kannst es dir ja nochmal \u00fcberlegen. Es ist wirklich eine tolle Sache, was wir da gefunden haben. George, komm!  Ich verstehe Sie nicht, Curtin, dass Sie mit denen wieder Gesch\u00e4fte machen. Hallo? Karner? Herr Johnson, wie sch\u00f6n, mal wieder Ihre Stimme zu h\u00f6ren. Ich habe das Gef\u00fchl, Ihre T\u00e4tigkeit ist in ein unangenehmes Stadium getreten, mein Verehrter. Pech f\u00fcr Sie. Ach, \u00fcbrigens noch was. Sie werden Mr. Curtin auf der Frequenz nicht mehr empfangen. Johnson, h\u00f6ren Sie!  Wir sind sich wohl dar\u00fcber klark\u00f6rten, dass sie Unannehmlichkeiten bekommen. Zuerst einmal werden wir beide uns gr\u00fcndlich unterhalten. Ich glaube, hier ist schon ewig keiner mehr gewesen. Man kann nicht mal das Ende sehen. Hier muss unheimlich weit rein gehen. Kommt! Das ist keine H\u00f6hle. Das ist ein Tunnel, den irgendjemand gebaut hat. Der ist ja unheimlich lang.  Er geht sicher weiter bis unten ans Meer. Was ist denn das? Das ist ein Hund. Hey, wer bist du denn? Wem der wo geh\u00f6rt? Keine Ahnung, vielleicht irgendjemanden am Strand. Timmy! Timmy, wo bist du? Das ist doch George. Ich h\u00f6re wohl nicht richtig. Das ist also ihr tolles Geheimnis. Kommt! Timmy, wie oft habe ich dir schon gesagt, dass du keine Kaninchen jagen sollst? F\u00fchlt sich nicht gef\u00e4hrlich an, wenn ich dir was sage.  Mach denn ein artiger Hund sowas? Du bist ein ganz schlimmer. Komm jetzt, muss man dir denn alles tausendmal sagen? Hallo, George. Dick. Das ist also Timmy. Woher wei\u00dft du denn seinen Namen? Du hast ihn doch gerade gerufen. Der hat uns einen gro\u00dfen Schreck eingejagt. Der ist ja wirklich s\u00fc\u00df, George. Geh\u00f6rt er dir? Ja. Und warum haben wir ihn noch nicht im Haus gesehen? Vater hat mir verboten, ihn zu behalten, aber ein Junge im Dorf versorgt ihn f\u00fcr mich. Ich w\u00fcrde lieber verhungern, als dass ich ihn weggeben w\u00fcrde. Und au\u00dferdem halte ich es um.  ihn auch nicht aus. Ach, jetzt kapiere ich das. Deshalb haust du also so viel ab. Aber du brauchst keine Angst zu haben. Wir verraten dein Geheimnis nicht. Ganz bestimmt nicht, George. Verspricht er mir das? Ja, wir versprechen es. Uns gef\u00e4llt dir doch genauso gut wie dir. Ja. Freunde? Freunde. Ich fand das sowieso nicht gut, dass wir Feinde waren. Was ich dir noch sagen wollte, George, der Tunnel, den wir gefunden haben, das ist kein normaler Tunnel. Sehr weit sind wir nicht gekommen, aber wir haben ein paar Stufen gefunden. Ja, die f\u00fchren direkt in die Erde. Und in Richtung Tumir.  raus kommst du mit na klar kommt hallo kinder aber es ist nun mit meiner einladung gehen wir lieber bevor er uns fragt was sie hier unten suchen ja ich habe sowieso hunger okay wir kommen macht euch bequem dann setzt euch schuldig das ist ein bisschen unaufger\u00e4umt ist  Seht euch mal das Fernrohr an. Oh ja, das ist mein Hobby. Ich beobachte V\u00f6gel. Karen Island. Oh, ich kann ja Onkel Quentins Turm ganz deutlich sehen. Eine Art Raben. Pyrokorax. Seltene K\u00fcstenv\u00f6gel. Ein paar davon habe ich auf der Insel ersp\u00e4ht. Tja, und euch habe ich nat\u00fcrlich auch gesehen. Na, wie geht es denn deinem Vater? Meinem Vater? Ach ja. Er ist fast fertig, hat er gesagt. Ach, ist er das? Ja. Der gute alte Quentin. \u00c4h, nun ja. Vielleicht k\u00f6nntet ihr mir helfen, den Tisch zu decken. Ein bisschen Kuchen und Kekse.  sind dort drin ich mache inzwischen den t nicht da oben du findest alles in dem unteren fach mein junge entschuldigung ach du meine g\u00fcte die tante ich meine meine tante tante john sie kommt zum tee habt ihr das vergessen sie kennen sie doch sicher so ja nat\u00fcrlich ja die tage ist wirklich reizend leider gleich weg tut mir leid auf wiedersehen und vielen dank  Tja, aber... Es war wirklich bl\u00f6d von uns. Entschuldigen Sie bitte. Trotzdem vielen Dank. Auf Wiedersehen. Na ja, dann vielleicht ein andermal. Wer ist denn Tante Joan? Wir haben \u00fcberhaupt keine Tante Joan. Nat\u00fcrlich nicht, aber trotzdem hat er gesagt, er kennt sie. Der tut nur so, als w\u00e4re er ein Freund von Vater. Aber ich habe den Kerl noch niemals vorher gesehen. Du h\u00e4ttest ihm nicht sagen d\u00fcrfen, dass Vater fast fertig ist. Du wei\u00dft genau, dass das geheim ist. Tut mir leid, George. Ich habe nicht daran gedacht. Meinst du nicht, du \u00fcbertreibst die Sache ein bisschen, George? Nein, nicht nicht.  Ich glaube, sie hat recht. Du hast bestimmt nicht gesehen, was in dem Schrank war. Da war ein Funkger\u00e4t, ein ziemlich gro\u00dfes. Oh Mann! Wirklich ausgezeichnet, Kirk. Nun ja, es tut mir leid. Sie waren so pl\u00f6tzlich weg. Ich konnte \u00fcberhaupt keine Fragen stellen. Ich habe alles geh\u00f6rt, was ich wissen wollte. Professor Kirin ist also, wie der Junge sagte, fast fertig. Nicht so verbissen, Kirk. Sie haben noch eine Menge vor heute Nacht.  Ja, vielleicht. Trotzdem glaube ich, dass wir uns viel zu viel Gedanken machen. Solange Onkel Quentin noch p\u00fcnktlich signalisiert. Es ist gleich halb elf. Ui, das Flugzeug fliegt aber tief. Das fliegt ja \u00fcber die Insel. Habt ihr sein Zeichen schon gesehen, Kinder? Nein, noch nicht. Muss jeden Moment kommen. Mach schon, Vater, los.  Los! Da! Eins, zwei, drei. Alles in Ordnung, George. Nichts passiert. Es ist alles in Ordnung, Tante Fanny. Gut. Jetzt ab ins Bett mit euch. Marsch, marsch. Puh, da bin ich aber erleichtert. Aber morgen fr\u00fch werde ich als erstes den Turm mit einem Fernglas beobachten. Gute Nacht. Gute Nacht. Nacht. Nacht.  Professor Kirin, nehme ich an. Wer zum Teufel sind Sie? Ich glaube kaum, dass Sie mich kennen. Mein Name ist Johnson. Ich bin vom Forschungsministerium. Gott sei Dank, Mr. Johnson. Im ersten Moment habe ich geglaubt, Sie w\u00e4ren so etwas wie ein... Ich war beim Forschungsministerium. Denn k\u00fcrzlich...  habe ich beschlossen, ein eigenes Ministerium aufzumachen. Verstehen Sie? Und dies ist der Anfang, Professor. Der beste, den ich mir denken kann. Hier auf Kirin Island.  keine Gefahr entgegen. Vertraut auf uns, wir packen's an, wer kann uns widerstehen? F\u00fcnf Freunde, das sind wir. Julian, Dick und Ed, George und Tim, wie der Hund. F\u00fcnf Freunde, das sind wir. Wir kommen schnell herbei, wann immer ihr das wollt.  Wir kommen schnell herbei Und schon sind wir da Sind wir da",
        "translated": "Whenever an adventure is worthwhile, we know no fear or terror, because we are used to it. Wherever there is a puzzle to solve, high up in the old castle or in the swing, yes, Mest, five friends, that's us. Julian, Dick and M, George and Tim, like the dog. And we are five friends. We come quickly whenever we want. And then we're there. Well, how are you, Mr. Rogers? Almost ready, Mrs. Kirill. Good. George! George! George! George, please get ready. And maybe you could tidy your room too, you have to... I want to be here any minute. How far is it, Julia? Maybe another mile. We drove about five miles from the station. It's unbelievable. Finally, we're going downhill. It's so beautiful here, isn't it? Yes, yes, great air. Oh, just look at the sea. That over there must be Cairn Island. Yes, it should be. What kind of strange tower is that? I have no idea. But Ginny probably knows that. Come on, let's at least be on time. George! Georgina! Really, Georgina. Georgina! Come here! That must be it. Come on! Come on! Excuse me. Is this Karen Cottage? Why do you want to know? We're relatives of Georgina. What? Her mother invited us. Professor Kirin was missing a lousy bunch like that. And three more who swarm around, make noise and disturb him at work. He's damn lucky that he's on the island most of the time. Then he must have built this strange tower. Yes, it has something to do with his experiment. But it's top secret, right? So be careful and don't chat about it with strangers. And don't get caught in one of my vegetable patches. Oh, there you are. It's nice to see you again. Hello, Aunt Fanny. You've grown a lot since I last saw you. Anne was just a baby then. Wait a minute, you must be Julian and this is Dick. So, how was the trip? Simply brilliant, Aunt Fanny. The journey from the station here was great. Yes, fine. I've called the station, your luggage is being brought here. Put the bikes behind the house, there'll be tea soon. I'm sure you're hungry too. And you, just imagine, the two of them nearly fell off their bikes. Andy in particular was so weak that he kept holding his head. He's somehow lacking vitamins. She always has to make stupid jokes. Yes, yes, your mother told me that you joke like that. Then you won't let it go, it will be suicide. Wonderful afternoon, Mr Johnson. Wonderful afternoon. Yes, I must say, Mr Johnson. I hope you ate well. Passable. There was just a bit too much talking. Time for a nice cup of office tea. Oh yes. Yes. Er, Miss Peters, I have to go away for a few days unexpectedly. I'm sure the Minister will manage without me until I return. Please have the car brought forward, Miss Peters. Yes, Mr Johnson. Thank you. I thought we'd all go to the island tomorrow and have lunch with Uncle Quentin. Great! Where's Georgina, Aunt Fanny? We've been looking forward to seeing her. I don't know where she is either. she is. Well, George always disappears when she shouldn't. But why do you call her George? She wants it that way. But then everyone thinks she's a boy and not a girl. Apparently she doesn't want it any other way. Well, I don't want people to think I'm a boy. No, of course not. But you're not like George either. Oh, I hope you show yourself sometimes. We've eaten almost everything. I'm not hungry. Thank you, Mother. Don't you want to say hello? This is Annie, Dick and Julian. Hello. Day. Hello. Hello. Why don't you go out with him, George, and show him around? But I've got to... Well, what? What do you have to do? Nothing. That's all right then. Off you go. I'll clear the table. Thanks for the tea, Aunt Fanny. The honey was quite good too. Have fun, children. Listen. Don't be late back. No, no. Aunt Fanny said we were going to Uncle Quenty's island tomorrow. Don't you think that's great, Georgina? My name isn't Georgina, it's George. And the island isn't his, it's mine. Why are you so upset? It's mine. He gave it to me. And now he works there and won't let me go at all. But if his work is such a big secret, why does he do it in a place where anyone can go if they want to? You can try it. and the cliffs off the island will turn your boat into splinters. Only Father and I know how to get through there. He's there because he needs a lot of time for his experiments. That's why he's on my island. I think it would be great, too, to work on my own island. Listen, I've got something to do now. That's only my business, got it? So don't sneak up on me, none of you. We've got better things to do. This could be fun with you. Well, it's not so bad for you, but I have to sleep in the same room as you. I'm telling you, it's going to take a long two weeks. Let's cook ourselves a meal. Can I get you another one? Why not, if you pay for it, I'd be happy to. Oh, that would be my pleasure. Please? Thank you. Timmy! Timmy! Oh, come on, Timmy, come on! Come on, come on! Come on, little one. Oh, Timmy. That's Quentin Curran's little one, isn't it? Yes. She's wilder than a boy. And most people here just call her George. Cheers. Cheers. And that's her dog. The professor. didn't want the dog in the house. She should give him away, but she's more attached to the mutt than anything else. Tell me, where is Quentin now? I haven't seen him for a long time. He's withdrawn almost completely to the island, experimenting. He doesn't come over at all anymore. His wife brings everything he needs over to the island. But first she always has to signal that everything is OK. Then he flashes a flashlight three times from the tower. Every morning and every evening at eleven, they can set their clocks by that. Everyone has their quirks. Isn't it crazy to work so much? Come on, I like it here. If only Georgina wouldn't behave so terribly stupidly. Just call her George. Whoever is last upstairs has to pay for the ice cream tomorrow. You're only saying that because I'm losing anyway. It looks very lonely here. Hey, look. It looks like a big cave. Come here. You can't see much. Come on, let's go deeper. We can't go in without a flashlight. OK, let's go back and get one. We don't have time for that. You know what, we'll come back tomorrow and examine it. then? Sure, she's not going to run away from us. Wait a minute. But we'll keep it to ourselves, OK? George has her secret and this cave is now our secret, OK? OK. Oh, hello kids. You're visiting Kirin Cottage, aren't you? Yes, that's right. Didn't George come with us? No. Your uncle and aunt are good friends of mine. Would you like to have tea with me tomorrow? Well, I don't know what we're going to do tomorrow... Well, it doesn't matter. Come if you feel like it. I'd be happy. Goodbye. Strange guy. The place is full of strange people. Aunt Fanny is the only normal person I've met here so far. Uncle Quentin seems to be a bit strange too. If we discover it tomorrow when we go over to the island, right? Can I row, George? No, the cliffs are too dangerous, but you can cast off. There are children sitting there. Father! Father! Is he always in his tower, Aunt Penny? No, when we call him he usually comes right away. George, take the boys and see if you can find him. OK, come on. I'm looking forward to dinner. Father! Father! Man, I've never seen anything like it. Look at that! Tell me, George, do you know what those things are up there on the tower? I imagine it has something to do with solar energy. The reflectors or whatever they're called might be somewhere else. Father! Father! He's probably not up there. He has to be somewhere. I'm here! Professor Curran. Your island seems to be attracting quite a bit of attention. You've grown since the last time. That was eight years ago, Uncle Quentin. Oh really? Then it was to be expected, don't you think? Where are you hanging out on the island at the moment? In the cellars. In the cellars? Under the ruins, the cellars of the old castle. Tell me, is that your secret laboratory? Yes, yes, if you want, you can. to name Georgia takes good care of you she rowed us out around the dangerous cliffs well done she can row better than a boy knows so now I have to go back I still have something to check thanks for the supplies George you can have your island back soon I'm as good as finished and don't forget the signals I'm not going to worry otherwise remember Have a good time. Well, bye then. Bye. Look, look. A delightful surprise to see you again, Curtin. Johnson. I suppose you are observing rare waterfowl, aren't you? What a splendid telescope. Yes, that is the... an excellent telescope. Oh, tell me, who are you working for this time? Russia, China, America? When we last met, you were very inconvenient for us, K\u00f6rten. I hope you are clear about that. Listen, I don't work for anyone. I give you my word. Your word. Oh, if that isn't a radio, I want to drop dead right now. That's enough. Thank you very much. Send in your life jackets, OK? There, and you wear this. Come on, children. George, what are you doing this afternoon? It's my business. I was just thinking, because we found something interesting. What is it? That's our secret. We're behind the hill at the end of the beach. You can think again. It's really a great thing we've found there. George, come on! I don't understand you, Curtin, doing business with them again. Hello? Karner? Mr. Johnson, how nice to hear your voice again. I have the feeling that your work has entered an unpleasant phase, my dear sir. Bad luck for you. Oh, and one more thing. You will no longer receive Mr. Curtin on the frequency. Johnson, listen! We are well aware that you will be inconvenienced. First of all, we will have a thorough talk. I don't think anyone has been here for ages. You can't even see the end. You have to go a long way in here. Come on! This is not a cave. This is a tunnel that someone has built. It is incredibly long. He's probably going down to the sea. What is that? It's a dog. Hey, who are you? Who does it belong to? I don't know, maybe someone on the beach. Timmy! Timmy, where are you? That's George. I must be hearing something. So that's their great secret. Come on! Timmy, how many times have I told you not to chase rabbits? It doesn't feel dangerous when I tell you something. Would a good dog do that? You're a bad one. Come on, do I have to tell you everything a thousand times? Hello, George. Dick. So this is Timmy. How do you know his name? You just called him. He gave us a big fright. He's really sweet, George. Is he yours? Yes. And why haven't we seen him in the house yet? Father has forbidden me to keep him, but a boy in the village looks after him for me. I'd rather starve than give him away. And besides, I'm keeping him. him either. Oh, now I get it. So that's why you run away so much. But you don't need to be afraid. We won't tell you your secret. Absolutely not, George. Does he promise me that? Yes, we promise. You like us just as much as you do. Yes. Friends? Friends. I didn't like the fact that we were enemies anyway. What I wanted to tell you, George, is that the tunnel we found is not a normal tunnel. We didn't get very far, but we found some steps. Yes, they lead straight into the ground. And in the direction of Tumir. you're coming out with of course come on hello kids but it's now with my invitation we'd better go before he asks us what we're looking for down here yes I'm hungry anyway okay we're coming make yourselves comfortable then sit down guilty that's a bit messy Look at the telescope. Oh yes, that's my hobby. I watch birds. Karen Island. Oh, I can see Uncle Quentin's tower quite clearly. A kind of raven. Pyrocorax. Rare shorebirds. I've spotted a few of them on the island. Well, and of course I've seen you too. So, how's your father? My father? Oh yes. He's almost ready, he said. Oh, is that him? Yes. Good old Quentin. Er, well. Perhaps you could help me set the table. Some cake and biscuits. are in there I'm not doing the t up there now you'll find everything in the bottom compartment my boy excuse me oh my goodness the aunt I mean my aunt aunt john she's coming for tea have you forgotten you surely know her like that yes of course yes the days are really lovely unfortunately soon gone I'm sorry goodbye and thank you very much Well, but... It was really stupid of us. I'm sorry. Thank you anyway. Goodbye. Well, maybe another time. Who's Aunt Joan? We don't have an Aunt Joan at all. Of course not, but he said he knew her anyway. He's only pretending to be a friend of Father's. But I've never seen the guy before. You shouldn't have told him Father was nearly finished. You know it's a secret. I'm sorry, George. I didn't think of that. Don't you think you're exaggerating a bit, George? No, not at all. I think she's right. You probably didn't see what was in the closet. There was a radio, a pretty big one. Oh man! Really excellent, Kirk. Well, I'm sorry. You left so suddenly. I couldn't ask any questions. I heard everything I wanted to know. So Professor Kirin is, as the boy said, almost finished. Don't be so dogged, Kirk. You've got a lot to do tonight. Yes, maybe. But I still think we're worrying too much. As long as Uncle Quentin still signals on time. It's almost half past ten. Wow, that plane is flying low. It's flying over the island. Have you seen his signal yet, children? No, not yet. It should be coming any minute. Come on, father, go. Go! There! One, two, three. It's all right, George. Nothing's wrong. It's all right, Aunt Fanny. Good. Now off to bed with you. March, march. Phew, that's a relief. But first thing in the morning I'll look at the tower with binoculars. Good night. Good night. Night. Night. Professor Kirin, I presume. Who the hell are you? I don't think you know me. My name is Johnson. I'm from the Research Department. Thank God, Mr. Johnson. At first I thought you were some kind of... I was at the Research Department. Because recently... I have decided to open my own ministry. Do you understand? And this is the beginning, Professor. The best one I can think of. Here on Kirin Island. no danger. Trust in us, we'll get to work, who can resist us? Five friends, that's us. Julian, Dick and Ed, George and Tim, like the dog. Five friends, that's us. We'll come quickly, whenever you want us to. We're coming quickly And we're already here We're here"
